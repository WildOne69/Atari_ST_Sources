 1) Q: How do I enter control codes on the function keys?

    A: This causes a lot of people trouble because they don't try
       the obvious; just press <Control> and the key. Example:

               <Control><A>

       enters the control code ^A (SOH), which is a small up-arrow
       in the Atari character set. Have a look at appendix B in the
       users guide for more information.

 2) Q: Why does UniTerm crash when I try to have it autostarted from
       the `Auto' folder?

    A: Because UniTerm is a fully-fledged GEM program, and GEM is not
       initialized when the programs in the `Auto' folder are run. There
       are various workarounds of this problem available, but they all
       depend on undocumented features of the operating system.

 3) Q: How to I run a program from UniTerm, I use [Run Program] but
       I always get TOS error 39?

    A: You have to tell UniTerm to give enough memory back to TOS
       (the Atari operating system) to run your program in. You can
       do this with the dialog that appears when you select [Buffers]
       from [Settings] menu, change the value for the `system' buffer
       to something larger than the size of your program (this can be
       quite a bit more, Tempus needs about 180kB to run in). If you 
       don't seem to have enough memory, check if you have the tektronix
       mode disabled (in the [Graphics] dialog), if you disable this
       function and save your default setup file, you should have 32kB
       more memory available.
   
 4) Q: On my German, French, Danish etc. keyboard UniTerm won't allow
       me to access a character that I have to press <Alternate> to get
       at, how to I get around this?

    A: I've tried to put all default <Alternate> key bindings on to
       keys that are not used by the BIOS, none the less it can still
       happen that there are conflicts. The solution is very simple
       the macro command:

            REASSIGN(alt-key,command)

       will allow you to assign a command to one of the <Alternate>
       key combinations, if you use 0 for `command' the character
       returned by the BIOS will be used, you can put a whole set
       of REASSIGN commands in your startup macro file to redefine
       the keyboard.

 5) Q: How do I change the size of the history buffer?

    A: Don't worry you're not stupid, I've had to explain this to 
       physics professors too. The 4 buffers (Transfer,System, 
       Clipboard,History) together represent the total free  memory 
       after UniTerm has been loaded*, this naturally means that
       you only have three free parameters. To change the size of the
       history buffer you have to change the size of the other three.

       * The RS232 input buffer is allocated separatly and only on
         startup.

 6) Q: Why doesn't UniTerm have a `fast' file transfer protocol like
       zmodem?

    A: A zmodem implementation would increase the size of the program
       by at least 30kB, considering the fact that it there is not very 
       much performance improvement in relation to using Kermit with
       large packets* and I've been unable to find a clean protocal 
       definition (I admit I haven't tried very hard), I decided not
       to add zmodem to the current UniTerm implementation.

       * Using Kermit with 2kB packets you get very near to the 
         theoretical speed possible on UniTerm to UniTerm transfers. The
         most recent C-Kermit implementation (4E) supports large packets,
         MS-DOS and VM/CMS Kermit have done so for quite a long time.

 7) Q: Why can't I put user-defefined strings on the arrow and keypad keys?

    A: Because UniTerm emulates a VT100 type terminal, and the strings sent
       by the arrow and keypad keys are defined by the terminal (in fact
       there are 4 different modi, I get enough telephone calls at 10 p.m.
       `The arrow keys aren't working in this and that editor' as it is, 
       without adding user defined keys).

 8) Q: How can I get the `Write to VDI-device' function to work?

    A: You need a copy of GDOS, the VDI metafile driver and if you wan't
       to output directly to a printer, a copy of the VDI printer driver.
       All these programs are copyrighted and can only be obtained by 
       buying expensive program packets, this is a result of Atari's attempt
       to deliberatly limit the usefulness of the ST.
       Once you have obtained above programs by paying a lot of money for
       a program you didn't want in the first place, you have to reserve
       enough system memory for the drivers, the metafile driver doesn't 
       need very much, the printer driver ~100kB.

 9) Q: Why can't MiGraph's Easy-Draw read metafiles created by UniTerm?

    A: Because MiGraph has got it's own ideas about what the header of a
       metafile should look like. There is a program in the public domain
       by Don Rice that transforms the normal (UniTerm) format to Easy-Draw
       format.

10) Q: Why doesn't UniTerm have this or that sexy feature?

    A: People sometimes forget that it's very easy to add features to a 
       product, but it is very hard to keep a program from growing to
       a unresonable size. UniTerm as it is, has reached a size that
       adding new features would actually reduce the usefulness of the
       program since the loading time would get too long and the memory 
       requirements would simply be too big.

11) Q: Why doesn't UniTerm use this and that feature of this program I have?

    A: Because I don't have that program and neither does a significant
       part of the ST user community. If you send me a free copy of the 
       program with documentation, then I'll consider adapting UniTerm to 
       it.

12) Q: Why doesn't UniTerm run with this neat program I have?

    A: (Typically asked in conjunction with microRTX, MTC or similar
        multitasking enviroments or shells) Same answer as 12). Don't
       forget that I do not have every single program written for the
       ST and I've only got a very small amount of money to buy such 
       programs.
