           ***********************************************


 - Background download, depends on how many other programs break.

 - Faster DH/DW chars (perhaps a reimplementation of TXTBLT).

 - Own keyboard interrupt handler (very maybe).

 - Multiple session control using UW protocol instead of D*C's
   proprietary protocol (very maybe).

 - Own RS232 interrupt handler (very maybe).

 - Host writable statusline.

 - Fix all bugs :-)
