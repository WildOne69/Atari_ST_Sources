$0%1!4#4HDom's Viewer version 1.20 - FreeWare software@#1

IDescription@

Dom's Viewer is a small text viewer working with all TOS system.
Doms Viewer works correctly with MagiC, Naes, Geneva, MultiTos.
According avec  new AES,  View's Dom  uses iconify window, Drag'n Drop
protocol and terminaison AES  message (AP_TERM). Dom's Viewer uses
Av-Protocol too.

IInstallation@

Copy  viewer.app,  viewer.rsc, windom.cnf  and viewer.hlp  in  the
same directory. windom.cnf  and viewer.hlp are  optional. I  don't
want to integrate  ressource file in  viewer.app in order to allow
an easy language translation. The file windom.cnf can be copied in
your HOME folder or in a PATH folder. Caution, since the version 1.2
the file viewer.cnf is replaced by the file windom.cnf.

DMultiTos:@
Add/Modify in your gem.cnf:
setenv SHSHOW [dom's viewer path]\viewer.app

DNaes:@
Add/Modify in your n_aes.cnf:
setenv SHSHOW [dom's viewer path]\viewer.app

DMagiC:@
Add or modify your magx.inf the line:
#_DPG C:\BIN\VIEWER.APP
or use appropriate MagXdesk menu (Options\Setting)

SingleTOS:
It is possible to use Dom's Viewer as GEM Desktop viewer instead of
the ugly standart viewer. Juste add in your NEWDESK.INF before the
lines  #G 03 FF 000 *.APP@ @ @ the line:
#G 03 04 200 C:\BIN\VIEWER.APP@ *.*@ @ 

DAs desk accessory:@
Dom's Viewer works as a desk accessory with all operating system. Just
rename VIEWER.APP to VIEWER.ACC. If you are using a singleTOS and a desk
managing the Av protocol, it will really be a good choice.

remark: with single-TOS, it is possible to iconify awindow pressing the
shift key and clicking the closer box. A window can be send in the
background pressing the shift key and clicking once the mover bar.

IConfiguration file@

Dom's Viewer reads a configuration file called windom.cnf to set
some parameters:

window = 60,20,400,300  # set window size and position
                        # -1 (for max text size) is possible for
                        # the fourth value
next = 10,10            # set the next window position 
next = -10,-10		    # negative value is available
tabulator = 5           # set the default tabulation size
text_color = 1		    # set the default text color (VDI index)
background = 8		    # set the default background color (VDI index)
font = 9,14			    # set the default id font and size font
editorpath = D:\QED\QED.APP   # set the text editor (called with the Control-E command)
editorav = true         # set to 'true' if the editor manages the AV-protocol

Caution: a space character is needed between the keyword and the '=' character.

The file windom.cnf is used by all application compiled with the GEM library
WinDom (since the nov. 97 version), and the HOME folder is a good location for
this file. In this file, the part concerning Dom's Viewer begin by the
anchor [VIEWER] and finish by [end] like that:

[VIEWER]
window = 60,20,400,300
...
[end]

This file sets the WinDom library behavior too. With Dom's Viewer, they are
two interessing variable:

mu_button_on_mouse = {true|false}
mu_keybd_on_mouse = {true|false}

The first value sets if the button events are applied to the window under
the mouse (true) or to the foreground window (false). The second value 
performs the same thing with the keyboard events. It is really usefull with
a big screen because a simple mouse displacement activ a window.

IText attributes@

Dom's Viewer uses Idealist escape code to display texts attributs such
as bold, underlined, ... effects. But Dom's Viewer uses extended escape
code to manage text color, background color and Gdos font.
Each escape code begins by  ($27) followed by a control character:

Normal      		@
ABold@            A
BLight@           B
DItalic@          D
HUnderlined@      H
SupScript       P    D(not yet implemented)@
Subscript       `    D(not yet implemented)@

Attributes can be combined as a bitfield. For example :
	CBold+Light	= C @.

Now, this is the extended escape code:

BackGround color	$Ai@
	Set the background color to Ai@.
Text color		#Ai@
	Set the text color to Ai@.
	
	Ai@ is a vdi color index:
	0 -> white
	1 -> black
	2 -> #2red#1
	3 -> #3green#1
	 ...
	9 -> #9light-black#1
	: -> #:light-red#1
	 ...

Text size			(Ai@		D(Not yet implemented)@
Justified text		)Ai@		D(Not yet implemented)@
Set font Name		&Ai@Hfont name@.
Set font			%Ai@

	& gives an index to a font name. Thus, the sequence
&A2@HCourier@. sets the HCourier@ font index to 2. Index 0 and
1 are reserved by Dom's Viewer. . shows the end of the string.
	%A2@ sets the font to courier. Of course, you need 
(Speedo)Gdos or NVDI to display font else this escape sequence will
be ignored.

Tabulation size		!Ai@

	Set the tabulation size to size Ai@.

Caution: Background color and Tabulation size can't be used
twice or more.

The bloc text does not work correctly yet. Soon i hope!
