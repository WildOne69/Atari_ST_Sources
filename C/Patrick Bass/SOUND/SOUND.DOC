				  Sound.Doc

	This is the documentation for the program Sound.prg which inter-
	faces to the sound chip of the ST.The interface is such that you
	can address each channel separately by  clicking the  mouse over  
	the designated area.  The interface  is color  coded as follows: 
	Red indicates that part is off and Green indicates that part is 
	on.
						
	When you first open sound.prg you will  see InSoft at  the top in 
	green.  By clicking in that  area you will be  getting out of the 
	program. The three areas named CHANNEL A, CHANNEL B and CHANNEL C
	are for the three channels of the ST. Freq. is for the frequency,
	ADSR is for the waveform  and Vol is for the volume for that per-
	spective channel.  The  areas below that give the  magnitudes for 
	that function.  For frequency  there is a  range of numbers.  The 
	ADRS has 10 waveforms along with a period shown on the right side
        of the  column which will also have a range.  The volume has six-
	teen levels. 

	By clicking the mouse you can change particular levels of a chan-
	nel or turn the channel off completely.  The Freq., ADSR and Vol.
	for each channel are a function  of each other.  When the ADSR is
	on the frequency and volume are off and the same goes for when the
	frequency and volume are on. Clicking on one will effect the other
	two.

	The initial state for this program  is CHANNEL A, B and C are off.
	When the  channels are  clicked on  then the functions  below will 
	take over.  The area will  fill  with  green  at  this  time.  See 
	AY38910.doc for  a quick reference guide for the ST sound chip and
	stsound1.c for a simple sound program.

	Sound.c and  sound1.c are the  c source  for  sound.prg. The c pro-
	grams were  compiled separately  and then linked with sound.c call-
	ing the  function  "test" in sound1.c.  All declarations are before
	main() in sound.c and test() in sound.c which means they are exter-
	nal and values will hold across the function call.

	Program specs
		-Frequency range is 80hz to 10Khz
		-ADSR envelope range is 0.1 to 8 seconds
		 The envelope is small column in ADSR
