GEMGIF is a GEM front-end for the freeware WHIRLGIF.TTP program
and also is freeware.  Please distibute this text with the program
and resource files.  Place these files in the same directory as
WHIRLGIF.TTP.  The GIF image files may be located anywhere.

==========================================================================
How to use GEMGIF:

Before starting GEMGIF.PRG, create a file containing a list of
the input GIF files, one line per file.  Give the file a .TXT 
extension.  Or, use the "Create GIF list" menu described below.

Edit>Create GIF list
You may also create the GIF listing file on the fly using this
menu item. 

1.  Press "Input" to enter the name of the listing file.  Use .TXT
as the extension.  If the file already exists, it will be over-
written.
2.  Press "GIF file" to select GIF files, one at a time.  If you
add a file by mistake, select it from the check list box so that
it has a check to the left of the file path.  Then press the "Delete"
button to delete it from the list.  You may check off as many files
as you want and delete them.  Hit "Clear all" to delete the entire
list and start again.

Edit>Parameters
Use this dialog to tell GEMGIF what options to send to WHIRLGIF.

1.  Press "Input" and choose the listing file created above.
2.  Choose "Loop" to make the animation a continuous loop.
3.  Choose an RGB value for transparent color, if desired.  Make sure
to select the "Transparent color" check box.
4.  Choose a delay value.
5.  Press "Output" and choose an output GIF file.  If the file already
exists, it will be overwitten.
6.  Click OK.

WHIRLGIF will run and you'll have a nice animated GIF file!
