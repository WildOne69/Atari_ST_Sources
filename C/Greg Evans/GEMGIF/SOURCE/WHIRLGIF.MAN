       whirlgif  -  a  quick  program  that reads a series of GIF
       files, and produces a single gif file  composed  of  those
       images.

       --vv     verbose mode

       --lloooopp [count]
              add the Netscape 'loop' extension.

       --ddiisspp method
              Sets the image 'disposal' method.

       --ttiimmee delay
              inter-frame timing.

       --ttrraannss index
              set the colormap index 'index' to be transparent

       --oo outfile
              write the results to 'outfile'

       --ii incfile
              read a list of names from 'incfile'

TTIIPPSS
       If  you don't specify an output file, the GIF will be sent
       to stdout. This is a good thing if you're using this in  a
       CGI script, a very bad thing if you run this from a termi-
       nal and forget to redirect stdout.

       The output file (if any) and  -loop  _MUST_  be  specified
       before any gif images.

       You  can  specify  several delay statements on the command
       line to change the delay between images in the  middle  of
       an animation, e.g.

       whirlgif -time 5 a.gif b.gif c.gif -time 100 d.gif -time 5
       e.gif f.gif

       Although it's generally considered to  be  evil,  you  can
       also  specify  several transparency statements on the com-
       mand line, to change the transparent color in  the  middle
       of  an  animation.  This  may cause problems for some pro-
       grams.

       The loop 'count' is ineffective because  Netspcape  always
       loops infinitely.

       should  be able to specify delay in an 'incfile' list (see
       next bug).

       Does not handle  filenames  starting  with  a  -  (hypen),
       except in 'incfile'.

       Needs better documentation.


TTOODDOO
       Only  save  colormaps  that  are different from preceeding
       ones.

       have an option that compares current image  with  previous
       and then only save the smallest rectangle that encompasses
       changes. I need sample code- the most efficient algorithms
       are patented?

       option for luma sorting of colormaps

       define extension block in order to have frame lists.
