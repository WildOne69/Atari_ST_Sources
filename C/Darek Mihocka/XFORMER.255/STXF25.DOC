Manual Errors
-------------

There are a few small typos in the manual. As the text written in April,
some minor changes in the program have to be accounted for, and some typos.

Page 1 - "writted" should be "written"

Page 5 - "Reboot - this..." should read "Power On Reset - this..."

Page 5 - "Reset - this..." should read "System Reset - this..."

Page 6 - "Debugger - enters..." should read "6502 Debugger - enters..."

Page 6 - "If Normal, it uses..." should read "If No, is uses..."

Page 6 - "If set to Fastchip, it ..." should read "If set to Yes, it ..."

Page 11 - "...article in ST LOG..." should read "...articles in ST LOG..."

Please let me know if I missed any others.


New features
------------

Version 2.4 used all but about 10K or 20K of a 520ST's memory. Version
2.5 uses slightly less than 2.4! TOS in ROM is required and no desk
accessories must be loaded on a 520ST.

The worst case machine to run ST Xformer 2.5 on is a 520STFMD. These
machines have TOS 1.2 built-in, which leaves about 20K less free
memory in the machine than TOS 1.0 and about 10K less than TOS 1.4.

The speed of 6502 emulation has been sped up by about 10% over version
2.3, and the screen output emulation (text printing, scrolling, graphics
scrolling) has been sped up by 20% to 50%. The result is that programs
are smoother and faster. For example, the LIST command from Atari BASIC
is up to twice as fast as before.

This release also has a built-in R: handler (modem handler), which
supports 1200 baud but has been tested successfully at speeds up to 2400
baud. The R: driver is not yet fully 850 compatible, so programs like
850 Express do not work. Do not try to run any such terminal programs
until the R: driver is properly fixed in a later release. It may crash!
Use the public domain BOBTERM program which is provided on the boot disk.

The F: device eliminates the need for using the Quick Transfer Utility
or the File Xfer Program. To move a file from 8-bit format to an ST
disk, simply boot up any Atari 8-bit DOS and copy the files to F:.
Wildcards usually can't be used with the F: device since DOS does not
recognize it as a disk but rather, as a character oriented device.
Some DOSes will support copies to F:*.*, some will not. I think that
MYDOS won't allow wildcards, but SpartaDOS has no objections.
If the file being read on the F: device doesn't exist, Xformer may crash.
There seems to be some problem with using F: with MyDOS, so I recommend that
this device be used with DOS 2.5 which is provided.

The internal speaker is now supported, so keyclicks and bells work,
although the sound is a bit funny. beep beep!

Antic mode 3 (8*10 font) is now properly emulated to support true
descenders on lowercase characters.

A memo pad is built-in rather than the XE self test code. This saves a
precious few K of memory, and if there is anything really wrong with
your ST's memory or video, you'll certainly know about it long before
your get to boot up the emulator!

Monochrome users will now enjoy support of all graphics modes.


Changed features
----------------

ST Xformer 2.5 changes the user interface that has been used in versions
2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, although the functionality is very similar. The
6502 debugger is the same as is the Save Picture option.

Virtual disks are still supported, and are still required when using
boot disks or programs that use AUTORUN.SYS files. For more consistency,
all virtual disk files now use a XFD extender (Xformer Floppy Disk) instead
of the SD and DD extenders used before. The file formats are still
the same, so simply rename all virtual disks to have an XFD extender.

Most .XFD files can be loaded into Xformer 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 by
just changing the path mask on the file selector when Inserting a
virtual disk.

Virtual disks are no longer kept in memory, but are accessed directly
on the floppy. This results in slightly slower disk speed, but the speed
is still considerably faster than a real 8-bit disk drive. GEMDOS may
cache several disk sectors in memory, so be sure to exit Xformer properly
if any disk writes are performed.

The 800XL memory emulation found in versions 2.1 thru 2.3 is supported
in version 2.5, as well as 130XE bank select memory emulation.

For memory reasons, Player Missle Graphics are not supported in 2.5.


Other features
--------------

In versions 2.2 and 2.3, there were two buttons marked PRINTER and CABLE.
When in the PRINTER position, it assumed that a real ST printer was
connected to the parallel port. When in the CABLE position, it assumed
the Xformer cable was connected. However, some people are using an
A-B switch box to connect both 8-bit disk drives and printers, and ST
printers to the parallel port. For this reason, there are now two
separate controls for the parallel port, marked D: and P:. When D: is
selected, all disk drives configured as External will attempt to use the
Xformer cable. When P: is selected, printer output will also try to go
though the cable to an 8-bit printer. Otherwise, printer output goes
to an ST printer. This may be a bit confusing since in all cases the
ST's parallel port is being used.

This release also supports virtual hard disk files, which emulate
8-bit hard disks up to 16 megabytes in size. SpartaDOS or MyDOS can be
used on them. The program MADE_XHD.PRG is provided to generate 8-bit
virtual hard disk files in one megabyte increments.


Upgrading from previous versions
--------------------------------

If you currently use ST Xformer 1.1 or 1.2, delete the files XFORMER.TOS,
and all FP, OS, CTA and FP files, and replace them with STXF25.PRG. Use the
F: device wherever you had previously used D:.

If you currently use ST Xformer 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, or Xformer Junior,
replace the file STXF2x.PRG with STXF25.PRG. Rename virtual disk files
from SD and DD extenders to XFD. No other changes are required.

Due to the memory limitations of the 512K machine, version 2.5 isn't
quite a superset of version 2.3, although many features are in common.
I can't guarantee that software that used to run on 2.3 will run on
2.5, and vice versa. Therefore, if you have a 1 megabyte machine, hang
on to version 2.31, and throw away any version earlier than 2.31. It
has a November 6, 1988 date displayed on it.


Disk Description
----------------

The following is the list of files on this disk:

  STXF25.PRG    - the main Xformer 2.5 program
  STXF25.DOC    - this text file (double click on it to read it)
  STXF231.PRG   - ST Xformer 2.31 (an earlier version)
  DOS25.XFD     - DOS 2.5 boot disk with disk utilities
  EMPTYXFD.ARC  - ARCed file containing 4 empty virtual disk files,
                  single, enhanced, double, and quad density
  QTU.PRG       - Quick Transfer Utility (for use with Xformer cable)
  FXP.PRG       - File Xfer Program
  MAKE_XHD.PRG  - program to generate large virtual hard disk files
  MAKE_XHD.C    - C source code to the MAKE_XHD utility
  QVIEW.PRG     - Quick View (use it to read text files)
  DESKTOP.INF   - standard DESKTOP.INF with QVIEW.PRG installed

Note that the QTU and the FXP are really not required anymore, but are
included for people who may wish to use earlier versions of Xformer.


Load and Save Context
---------------------

One handy use for context saving is if you are in the middle of some
8-bit program that can't be saved (for example, in the middle of
generating a fractal image). Simply do a Save Context and save it out
as the file AUTOEXEC.XCX. Then, the next time you load Xformer 2.5, it
will automatically load the AUTOEXEC.XCX file and continue running the
fractals program.

At the moment, context saving does not include the disk drive configuration,
so that must still be done manually. Also, it does not save the contents
of XL or XE bank select memory. I'll try to get these problems fixed in 2.6.

The AUTOEXEC.XCX file provided on this disk automatically boots the
computer into the DOS 2.5 menu. You can select option H (write DOS files)
to a blank single density virtual disk to create a DOS 2.5 boot disk.


Xformer cable
-------------

If anyone still hasn't picked up a Xformer cable, they are available at
some Atari dealers. if not, they can order them, or you can order them
directly from Innovatice Concepts. Call (313)-293-0730 for details.

The diagram on page 12 of the User's Manual fails to mention that the
DB-25 is a male connector, since it plugs into the ST's printer port.

A few people reported some problems with reading disks using their disk
drive and Xformer cable. It would work with the QTU but not with Xformer
2.31, or vice versa. I suspect it is a baud rate problem, since the cable
doesn't exactly generate a 19.2 kilobaud signal, but something very close.
There is an option to adjust the speed. When configuring a disk drive, there
are a few small boxes beside the "External" option, marked with a + and -
sign. A few lines below that the number 31 is displayed. Clicking on + or
- will increase and decrease the number, which controls the baud rate.
I found that either 30 or 31 worked fine on my XF551. Some disk drives
may require that the number is increased or decreased slightly. If this is
the case, please let me know about it, as I'm interested in finding out
what the ideal number should be.

I assume that by now everyone is familiar with the File Xfer Program and
the Quick Transfer Utility. Both programs have been around since last
summer, and are not documented in this latest User's Manual. They're
easy to use, trust me! The QTU reads entire 8-bit disks and stores them
as virtual disk (.XFD) files. The FXP then lets you extract individual files
from the virtual disk. This can be accomplished easier using the F: device.


Hard Disk Emulation
-------------------

This feature only works if you have a hard disk or 10 meg floppy on your
ST. It should also work on a Mega 2 or 4 with a RAMdisk larger than 
1 megabyte.

8-bit hard disks are emulated by using virtual disk files, similar to
XFD files. The files use a XHD extender to distuinguish them. Use the
program MAKE_XHD.PRG to generate a virtual hard disk file, from 1 to 9
megabytes in size. Source code is included for those who wish to modify
the program, since 8-bit hard disks can be any size up to 16 megabytes in
256 byte increments.

Once this file is created, boot up with the BOOTXF25 disk, then reinstall
D1: as the virtual hard disk. Use the reconfigure option in MYDOS to 
reconfigure D1: as a configurable disk, with 4000 sectors per megabyte
in size (e.g. a 9 meg hard disk has 36000 sectors). Then format D1: and
write DOS to it. The virtual hard disk is now ready to use.

SpartaDOS can also be used. I know of no other 8-bit DOS that supports
hard disks. MYDOS and SpartaDOS disk formats are not compatible, so you
must choose between one or the other. SpartaDOS 1.1 must be used for now.
I have a patch for SpartaDOS versions 2 and 3, which I'll make available
when I'm sure it works with all versions.

XFD and XHD files cannot be interchanged except for one special case. A
180K floppy disk is identical to a 180K hard disk as far as the emulator
is concerned, since hard disks use double density sectors.


Bugs Bugs Bugs
--------------

Since this disk is only holds 400K, some of the files included with
previous releases of Xformer (such as the 800K version 2.31 disk) are
not included. There files, such as Xformer 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and sample
virtual disks, can be downloaded from the Xformer support BBSs.

If you have any questions about this release of ST Xformer, please call
me any time after 6pm at (519)-747-0386. Sorry, no collect calls. I am
usually at home, but if I'm not, there is an answering machine.

Here are the known bugs in 2.5:
  - F: doesn't support burst I/O or work with some DOSes
  - SpartaDOS 2 and 3 need a patch to work
  - R: doesn't properly emulate the 850
  - joystick latching is not supported
  - a bug in SIO read emulation is still not fixed
  - custom SIO is not supported
  - context saving doesn't save XL/XE memory or configuration
  - the BOLD font shows up when it shouldn't
  # support for RAM under BASIC
  # support for self-test ROM
  # display list interrupts
  # player missle graphics and GTIA modes not supported any more
  - 16-bit sound support is not supported
  - 3.5" 8-bit disks are not supported
  -  graphics modes 1, 2, and 3 only appear in 2 colors instead of 4
  - keyboard sometimes locks up and/or repeating keyclicks are heard
  - VCOUNT and RANDOM hardware registers not supported in real-time
      (this had to be done for speed reasons, but might break some prorgams)

On the other hand, here is what I have accomplished over the last 6 months:
  - support for 130XE bank select memory
  - 8 disk drive support with more versatility 
  - added F: and R: devices
  * reduced program memory requirements from 850K to 390K
  * recoded many routines in pure 68000 assembler
  * increase speed of emulation by about 20%
  - runs on any 520ST (monochrome or color), all versions of TOS
  - context load and save
  - internal speaker support

The items with * are closely related and took about 4 months of coding and
recoding until it all fit into 512K. Unfortunately some compromises had
to be made to fit it into 512K, as indicated by the # items above. Hopefully
version 2.6 will be even more compact, allowing me to add those extra
features in.

One addition being planned for version 2.6 is the ability to run 
cartridges like MAC/65, Action!, BASIC XL/XE, Atariwriter, and others.
I am presently designing a cartridge port adaptor which will allow this
to work.

At this moment, Xformer version 2.31 is the most stable release of the
software, which is why I suggest you hang on to that version in case
something doesn't run under version 2.5. But, version 2.31 requires
a one megabyte ST.

The future
----------

Although ST Xformer is public domain, I will be doing the Xformer 2.6 update.
However, I have not decided whether to make it ST compatible or make it for the
Atari STe computer. This is the new enhanced ST which has sound and graphics
which is improved, and almost like on the 8-bit Atari. Scrolling is better,
and there are now 5 voices of sound, including two 8-bit digital channels.

The STe update requires an Atari STe of course (which are all over the place
here in Canada), which means that it will not run on earler machines. I
strongly recommend to all ST owners to dump your 520ST and 1040ST machines
while you can still get any money for them and buy STes. Not only is the
STe the same price as a regular 1040ST, but it includes 1 meg of RAM, TOS 1.6,
a blitter chip, digitial stereo sound (with audio jacks), 6 joystick ports,
and runs faster than previous Atari STs. I LOVE this machine.

Look for the ST Xformer update sometime in the summer of 1990. I have decided
to get out of the public domain and shareware business and start my own
software company, called Branch Always Software. We are currently marketing
the QUICK ST software accelerator for the Atari ST. It is $19.95 at a dealer
near you.

Unfortunately, due to the terms of my agreement with Atari regarding the
8-bit emulator, it is not possible to market ST Xformer through my company.
This is one of the reasons I decided to make it public domain.

Look for future product announcements from Branch Always Software very soon.

Please ignore the message in the Xformer 2.31 and 2.55 desktops. Neither
ST Xformer nor Quick ST are shareware any more, and the phone numbers are
wrong.

My current phone and mailing address is:

I apologize for the length of time that it may have taken me to send out this
disk to some people. After I made Xformer public domain in Septemer, I was
busy with all sorts of other projects, including setting up Branch Always
Software. And I was out of the country for a few months, which made mail
difficult to get sometimes. All this is another reason to set up a software
company rather than try to go it alone as a one man shareware operation.

Remember, I do not make or sell the Xformer cables. I have forwarded some
orders for the cables to Innovative Concepts, but I would prefer to not have
to at all. So please do not order them from me.
