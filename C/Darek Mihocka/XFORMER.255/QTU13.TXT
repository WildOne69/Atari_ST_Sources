
ST Xformer II Quick Transfer Utility 1.3
----------------------------------------

This version is very similar to the one documented in the 2.2 User's Manual,
with a few small changes. The "READ" buttons are now called "8-bit to ST",
and the WRITE buttons are called "ST to 8-bit". The QUERY buttons have
been removed since that is now done automatically. Also, the number of
drive buttons has been increased to 8.

The bug with erratic mouse movements during disk I/O has been fixed.

Run STXF_QTU.PRG. When the dialog box appears, select the drive number of the
connected disk drive. In most cases, it will be D1:. Then select one of the
four functions:

    - disk transfer from the 8-bit disk to the ST
    - disk transfer from the ST to the 8-bit disk
    - file transfer from the 8-bit disk to the ST
    - file transfer from the ST to the 8-bit disk
    - format single density
    - format double density

The disk transfer functions use the .SD and .DD files used by the
ST Xformer II emulator. When transfering a disk from the ST to the 8-bit,
the program makes a check to see if the disk in the drive is formatted to
the correct density. If not an alert box will pop up, in which case you
should either change disks or format the disk.

The file transfer options will prompt you to use the FXP program. I have 
not added those features to QTU yet, but they are available in FXP, provided
that you create the .SD and .DD files first. Hope to have those features in
soon.

The format commands are very simple. You click on either the SINGLE or
DOUBLE buttons, and off goes the disk drive to format a disk. Be sure that
you really want to format a disk when you press these buttons!
