Minixfs is copyright S.N. Henson 1991,1992,1993.
This code may be freely distributed unmodified, provided this copyright notice
is intact. A small copying fee may be charged for redistribution provided this
does not exceed the equivalent of five pounds Sterling (UK currency).

	You are free to compile, modify and recompile modified versions of this
program, however redistribution of modified versions is not allowed without
my consent, this is because making apparently minor changes to the code can
cause considerable damage (as I can testify).

	Binaries compiled from this code may be not be redistributed. If you
wish to distribute binaries then use the binary version of this release.

	This version may not be used for profit or in a commercial environment,
this includes the development of software that requires a registration fee.
If you wish to use Minixfs to develop anything other than free software or use
it in a commercial environment then Minixfs must be registered for a small fee,
please contact me for further details.

	Distribution of this program with commercial packages is not allowed
without my written permission, please contact me if you wish to do this,
or indeed if you want a similar filesystem writing for a different purpose
(e.g. TT Unix or Spectre), however I am not in a position to write filesystems
for other commercial packages free of charge.

	I reserve the right to modify these conditions at some future date.

	This program is not 'shareware' and no registration fee is levied. If
you find this program useful I would appreciate a donation sent to the address
in 'minixfs.doc'. I currently have negligible resources so anything would be
appreciated.

	Please note that although I believe each release to be stable and
test it thoroughly I offer no guarantee. Therefore, THIS PROGRAM COMES
WITH NO WARANTEE WHATSOEVER AND USE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK, I WILL
NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM ITS USE.

	Please do not abuse the conditions of this copyright. Abuses may 
result in some or all of the following.

1. Distribution of binary only versions in future.
2. Charging a 'shareware fee' and only distributing severely crippled 'demo'
   versions (financial considerations may force this anyway).
3. My giving the whole thing up for something that pays more ...
