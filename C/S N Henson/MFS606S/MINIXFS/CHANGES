Version 0.60.
Revision history .....
	0.0   Single-partition read-only version with no filename conversion.
	0.1   Added multi-partition support and filename conversion for TOS
	      domain ... added cache.
	0.2   Added write support 90% of TOS functions emulated. No write
	      cache yet ... and no access checking.
	0.25  Fixed m_seek bug.
	0.3   Added write cache and remaining tos functions fixed some bugs
	      when long files were read/written. Made search_dir more tos-like.
	0.31  Fixed some bugs . Made it permissible to delete an open file
	      (just like unix). Added full-disk error checks and minor code
	      tidy up.

--------------------First Release with MiNT 0.7----------------------------

	0.32  Added 'zlast' to speed up free zone searches. Also added
	      consecutive zone read/write to speed up i/o . Fixed bugs
	      all over the place with curdir .
	0.33  Fixed code for > 512 byte sectors. Merged add_zone and
	      find_zone, new code should support sparse files .
	0.34  Tentative support for floppies and removeable media . Tidied up
	      and removed redundant code (like minix_init() ) .
	0.35  Added access checking to all relevant functions.
	0.40  Added some un*x like inode related functions , fixed up m_rename
	      to be more robust (and related things in find_path). Fixed up
	      m_creat and merged zap_inode() with new function trunc_inode().
	      Not to mention fixing the occasional bug (or two).

--------------------Second Release with MiNT 0.8---------------------------

	0.41  Cleared up a few bugs, separated system and user caches.
	0.50  Changed stuff all over the place for new fs code in 0.9 and
	      addition of file sharing code, hard and symbolic links (yeah!).
	      converted to loadable filesystem.
===================All Subsequent Versions Are releases====================
	0.51  New compilation option TOS_LWR and tosify filenames from readdir
	      only if in compatability mode (and all domains).
	0.511 Nasty bug fixed in find_zone which screwed files bigger than 1Mb.
	0.52  Added V2 filesystem support. Extended RWABS now used, as required.
	      Code changed all over the place, new alerts added if some problems
	      are noticed in the filesystem.
	0.53  Added code to handle large directory entries.
	0.54  Overhaul of tosify code, translation now selectable by fscntl.
	0.541 Fixed bug which crashed v2 filesystems.
	0.55  Added ROBUST compilation option and file locking.

	0.60  Major code reorganisation, split up into separate files, fixed
	      bugs relating to large partitions (crwabs with 1K sectors and
	      unsigned types in read/write_zones instead of longs and dfree).
	      Introduced some enhancements for faster I/O, such as cache
	      guessing, pre-reading, and flushing consecutive cache entries.
	      Tosify now also drive dependent.
	pl1   Fixes to keep gcc 2.3.3 happy.
	pl2   Support for new calls/parameters in updated fs format.
	pl3   Support for larger partitions: pun_info/XHDI.
	pl4   Bugfixes for larger partitions and 0xffff inodes.
	pl5   Asynchronous update daemon, physical partition suport, dummy fses,
	      still more bugfixes for large partitions and larger pun's .
	pl6   Bugfixes: inode search (fsck) and stop compiler warnings.
	      FUTIMES/FTRUNCATE support added (untested).
	      Following are all courtesy of Andreas Schwab (thanks!):
	      Multiple opens with O_TRUNC locked up, unlinking of open files was
	      handled incorrectly, FILEPTR structures should be freed up on a
	      disk change. Various other fixes and code tidy.
