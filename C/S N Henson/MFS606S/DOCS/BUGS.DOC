No this isn't a list of bugs, its a list of what to do when you send a bug
report. I've included this because lots of bug reports I receive are incomplete
and I have to email back asking for more information, and often receive no
reply. It costs me real money to do this which is in very short supply.

	Please use one of the following methods:

1. Technical description of bug, basically where it is in the source and/or a
   fix.

2. As much information as possible about the bug. You should include:

a. Your hardware and hard disk driver software.
b. Version of MiNT, Minixfs and TOS.
c. As much information as you can about the bug. If I can't recreate the bug
   then there isn't much I can do to fix it. Basically some method (as simple
   as possible) to recreate the bug is best, also if fsck complains before
   or after the problem as well. All relevant alerts or debugging/trace info
   would help as well.

	Please remember I have an STE and limited software, so if you say "When
I run x.prg on a minix partition it crashes" and 'x.prg' is commercial software
then I can't really do much to help. If 'x.prg' is free then I may be able to
download it. Alternatively if you know how to recompile minixfs and you don't
mind doing a few tests then I may be able to trace things that way. In any case
you should be prepared to answer a few questions at least.

Reports should be addressed to:
shenson@nyx.cs.du.edu
If you send it to Usenet then I may well miss it.
