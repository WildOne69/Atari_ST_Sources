Quite a few things have changed in pl5. The NUM_MINIX compilation option has
gone away as well as restricting the number of minix partitions to NUM_MINIX.
I've made quite a few bug fixes wrt large partitions; some of the things were
just plain wrong: minit -t didn't work properly and minit would not create huge
partitions without XHDI compliance. minit -t now sends some debugging info
which should be checked (partition boundaries) before invoking the full minit. 
There have been reports that under XHDI huge partitions work OK except that
minixfs/fsck don't work with 65535 inodes (the maximum allowed for V2 fses):
this bug should also be fixed.
	In case I didn't make it clear before: a huge partition is one in which
the logical sector size is bigger than 1K. In practice this means a partition
size of bigger than 64Mb (or perhaps 32Mb).
	If you are using ICD software then read the file "icd.bug".
	Minixfs can now be operated in three modes: Robust which makes it almost
bomb proof (and slow), Normal which is the same behaviour as before and Turbo
which only writes data out periodically and is somewhat quicker. To set the
mode edit the CACHE_MODE line in 'config.h' and recompile. Turbo mode can cause
excessive disk swapping in single drive systems when copying from A: to B: this
will be fixed in later versions. Another bug is when you force a media change
on a V2 partition (e.g. ESC with desktop) this makes an alert appear. This is a
bit tricky to fix but I'm looking into it.
	Another thing to note is that running GEM programs under non Multi TOS
can stop the updater working properly install the program 'nohog.acc' as a DA to
prevent this.
	A binary configuration program is under construction which allows many
of the parameters to be set without recompilation e.g. cache sizes, cache mode
default translation modes etc.
	Final note: it looks like protection is going to be even more painful
than I feared ... I'm not sure it is even *possible* to protect huge AHDI
partitions from TOS access when MiNT/Minixfs isn't running (this applies to AHDI
software only).
