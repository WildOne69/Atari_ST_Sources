OK this is info about my pre-alpha version of fsck(8). It does all manner of
horrible tests and should clear up most errors. Here is a brief summary of tests
and actions taken.

Check Zones claimed more than once by inodes, and offer option of selective
deletion of the zones (unlike BSD fsck it doesn't zap the inodes, so something
at least should be recoverable), like most fsck's it currently goes mad if an
indirection block is overwritten due to it being claimed by multiple inodes.

Check for bad '.' or '..' entries in directories and fix. Check for multiple
hard links to directories. Check bad links (inode numbers out of range or links
to free inodes) and fix.

Check Filesystem connectivity, allow reconnection of orphaned inodes in
'lost+found' directory.

Check link counts, altering as required.

Check inode and zone bitmaps and repair if needed.

Some other things I've probably forgotten.

	This could be a bit buggy, so be careful! In fact it could be a lot
buggy so be *very* careful :-) 

	Usage is: fsck X: this allows interactive repair (i.e. prompts before
trying anything clever). Also fsck -n X: which just finds errors and prohibits
writing to the drive. fsck -y X: answers all the questions in interactive mode
with 'y', this is not a recommended option yet ...

	Also a '-d X' option, where 'X' is the directory increment, this causes
the checker to use 'X' as the directory increment for the filesystem in 
question. Getting this wrong is a bad idea ... Without this option fsck
determines this value for itself, which should be OK unless the root inode is
severely trashed.

	fsck -R will trash the root inode and minixfs will recover the
filesystem. Believe me, you DO NOT want to try this.

	'-s' prints summary info. '-S' prints out a bit more summary info.

	The option '-i' is an inode searcher. Follow it by a comma separated
list of inode numbers and it should print out their pathnames.

	Let me know of any bugs, I specifically want to know if, after making
all suggested repairs, it still indicates errors after rerunning.
