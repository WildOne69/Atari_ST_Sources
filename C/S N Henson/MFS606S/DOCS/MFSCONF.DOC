This is mfsconf.c is a sample program to set up the filename translation modes
for minixfs version 0.54 or above. It must be run after minixfs has loaded.
Changes are global (i.e. affect all programs) and immediate. The syntax is

mfsconf pathname
or
mfsconf pathname -[s|d|x|l] [n|t|m|b]

'pathname' is the path of a minix partition you want the translation to apply,
to e.g. E: in my setup. The first form (no options) prints out a summary of 
current translation options. The second form is used to set the options. The
first letter determines the option to be set and may be 's','d','x' or 'l' .
These have the following meanings:

's' is search translation, when a filename is searched for, e.g. when it
is being opened, it is translated into 8+3 tos format as well as the 
actual search name. So for example FooBarFile.C becomes FOOBARFI.C which may
then be accessed as anything that translated to FOOBARFI.C, e.g. FooBarFI.c
FooBarFilename.C .

'd' is the directory option, when reading a directory with Fsfirst/Fsnext or
Dreaddir in 'compatability' mode the filenames get translated to tos 8+3, 
upper case format. Anything that doesn't recognise MiNT will be affected.
Many GEM programs don't like the mixed case filenames e.g. the desktop and
file selector, so this option should keep them happy, it is advisable
to have 's' mode on too with this, since if FoobarFilename.C  appears
as FOOBARFI.C then without 's' it wont be accessible as this. Dreaddir in 
normal mode is *never* translated, since if a program knows about this then
it should handle mixed case long filenames properly.

'x' is auto-execute permission. If a file is created with the standard TOS
executable extensions (TTP,TOS,ACC,PRG,APP,GTP) in either case then the
file automatically get execute permission added. This is useful for copying
files with programs that don't recognise MiNT, e.g. the desktop.

'l' is lower case creation translation, that is files created are translated
to lower case, so if FOOBAR.C is created with this option the actual file
will be foobar.c .

The second letter is a 'scope' and may be 'n','t','m' or 'b' and specifies 
which domain the translations will occur in . These stand for 'Neither',
'Tos domain','Mint domain' and 'Both'.

You can specify multiple options, for example :

mfsconf E: -d b -x n
