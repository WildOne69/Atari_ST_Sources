			handy subroutines

a couple of subroutines that I've found helpful:

MSECOORD displays the current mouse co-ordinates in a window. it's 
updated as you move the mouse around. can be useful when you're 
finding the location for a zone, sprite or whatever.

ZONENO displays which zone the hotspot of the mouse pointer is in 
(if any). again, it's updated as you move the mouse around. helps 
you to check that you've defined a zone correctly.

just add the relevant subroutine to the end of your program and 
gosub to it at the right point in your code. i hope you find them 
useful.
