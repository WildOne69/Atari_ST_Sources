          STOS Screen Saver ACB
          ---------------------

There doesn't seem to be a single screen saver that works while STOS is
running. No problemo - just write your own. Here's one I prepared
earlier. Copy it into your STOS folder where your other .ACB files live.
To install it type ACCLOAD"SAVER" or run CONFIG.BAS and add it to the
list of accessories to be installed automatically when you load STOS.
When you want to set it going press HELP, then the appropriate function
key, and choose one of the options from the menu. The Starfield option
won't work unless you have the Stars extension loaded. This program is 
PD. It only takes up 2.5k of memory and, because it's written in STOS, 
you can alter it or add your own bits if you want to.

Vegetable rights and peace.
