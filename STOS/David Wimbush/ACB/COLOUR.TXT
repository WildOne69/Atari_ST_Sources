This is a colour mixing accessory. I don't know about you, but mixing red 
green and blue to make yellow does not come naturally to me. Unless I'm 
missing something STOS doesn't offer any help here unless you load the 
sprite designer which will load its own palette. Try this instead. It 
displays each colour from your current palette with its red, green and 
blue levels. Click on the colour you want to edit and use the buttons to 
adjust its levels. Then pick the next colour.  When you quit it will 
clear the screen and print your new palette as a program line which you 
can incorporate into your program. It has a memory overhead of about 5k.
