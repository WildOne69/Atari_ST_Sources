	hi,

here's another game nicked straight from the crystal maze!
all you have to do is put all 6 pieces on the board so that no 2 
pieces are in the same row, column or diagonal line. (that doesn't 
just mean the 2 lines from corner to corner - there are 18 
diagonals!) to move a piece, click on it and it will move with the 
mouse. click again when you want to drop it.

there are 3 menu options. "correct?" will check whether you've got 
it. if you have it will say so. if you haven't the offending 
smiley-faces will be turned into bummer-faces. either way click 
again when you're ready to go on. "show me" will show you one 
possible answer (there are others) but you won't be needing that, 
will you? "quit" is one way of getting out. another would be to do 
something i haven't thought of. probably.

one last thought. if you were driving along in your spacecraft at 
the speed of light and you turned on the headlights, would any 
light shine out ahead of you?
