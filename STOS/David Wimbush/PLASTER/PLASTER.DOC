you guessed it - another ripped-off game! again, nobody's really 
profiting from it and they didn't do an official one, so sue me. 
this is not the full version of the rules, by the way. no doubles 
or spaces are allowed because that's the way i've always played 
it. 6 guesses just aren't enough with those extra variables. their 
way you're just starting to get an idea of which colours are in it 
when you run out of guesses.

i tried to code it with an options screen but it was giving me 
gyp. then one night, after i'd had a few, i thought "sod this, i 
don't even want these features" and deleted those bits. (not that 
i think drinking is clever, but i find it's the best way to get 
drunk!) please feel free to add these options on the following 
conditions:

1.	you keep the current rules available in your new version
	(i know they're not the proper ones, but they're good)
2.	you make sure your new version works properly
	(it's harder than you might think (ooer!) - what if
	 doubles are allowed and they take a peg off the board?)
3.	you keep me in the credits as the originator
	(well, i did do most of the work)
4.	you send me a copy of the new version

enjoy the game and maybe send me a postcard if you get a lot of 
fun out of it. live long and prosper.
