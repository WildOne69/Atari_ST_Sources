				PIX

Tired of seeing the same picture every time you boot up STOS? I 
know I am! Well now you can use PIX to get a different one every 
time. It randomly chooses a .PI1 file from a folder you name and 
replaces your current STOS boot-up picture. Once you've set it up 
it will do this automatically every time you boot up without 
bothering you.

PIX is PD and written in STOS. It works fine on a system with a 
single floppy drive and/or hard drive, and I'm sure it will handle 
two floppies although I couldn't test this.

Sounds cool - how do I use it?
Set up a folder and put your .PI1 files in it (including your 
current PIC.PI1 because PIX always overwrites this). Run 
PIX_CNFG.PRG and input the full pathnames of your picture folder 
and your STOS folder. They can be located anywhere on any drive 
which will be available when you boot up (although they don't have 
to be available at this point). Make sure you get the formats 
exactly right - look at the examples on screen. It will create a 
file called PIX.DAT. Put this on the root directory of your 
boot-up disc, and put PIX.PRG in your auto folder. Now just lock 
'n' load!
