Midi Extension
--------------

midi on buffstart,buffend,start,filter,end

=midi in
midi out
midi off

To start the MIDI routine use the MIDI ON command

buffstart=start address of a bank you will be using as your MIDI buffer 
(about 256 bytes)

buffend=end address of this bank

START=start code.If not set to 0,the midi routine will only start accepting
data once it receives the code(so you can wait for particular messages)

FILTER=filter code.If not set to 0,any occurences of this value will be
filtered out by the midi routine.

END=end code.

MIDI IN function pulls the next byte of data from the buffer.If it is
-1 then there is no data available.

MIDI OUT command allows you to send 1 byte of data to the MIDI OUT
port.Of course you can do multiple MIDI OUT commands to send longer
messages.

MIDI OFF command swites off the MIDI interupt.

Examples in the STE folder.
MIDICOM.BAS
midi communicator

MIDITEST.BAS
midi message analyser,tests incoming MIDI commands from synths and
tells you what they are.


Usefull Extension
-----------------

SPRPAL START(1) - gets colour palette from sprite bank

=RANGE(A,B,C) - if a is in range b-c it returns a, otherwise it will
force a into range. (so b<=a<=c).

PRINTER data - sets up printer port.
