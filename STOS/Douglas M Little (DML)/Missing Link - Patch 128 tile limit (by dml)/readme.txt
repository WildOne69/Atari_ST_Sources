A patch by Douglas Little (dml) for the Missing Link extension, to allow for more than the standard 128 block limit in eddy.  Retrieved from Atari Forum via pm.

Not 100% confirmed if this works completely.  So far, so good but keep a backup of your original LINK1.ECQ & LINK1.EXQ files, just in case anything breaks.
