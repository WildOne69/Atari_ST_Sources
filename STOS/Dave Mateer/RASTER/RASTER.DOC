Raster Extension
________________

First of all,load the routine into a bank ( I recomend 14 )

You need to set up two data banks of identicle length..

1..Colour data

set up a bank with as many colours you want but make sure that the
last number in the bank is $FFFF as the routine checks for this

2..Gap data

The gap-data bank determines how many pixels wide each raster will
be.This bank should be exactly the same length as the colour bank.


TO RUN 
______

first of all you have to set up some parameters..

dreg(0)=mode                1 for on or 0 for off
dreg(1)=line                the line which the first raster will appear on
areg(0)=colour register     the address register of the colour you want the
                            rasters to appear in.There is a list of these
                            registers at the end of this document.
areg(1)=colour data         the address of your colour data
areg(2)=gap data            the address of your gap data
 

EXAMPLE
_______


dreg(0)=1 : dreg(1)=3 : areg(0)=$ff8240 : areg(1)=start(5) :
areg(2)=start(6) : call start(14)+28


TO STOP
_______

dreg(0)=0:callstart(14)+28


PROBLEM
_______

Unfortunately, when the raster routine is on, the inkey$ command will not
respond.

SOLUTION
________

To check for a key press you have to peek the keyboard register....


C=peek($FFFC020): if C=K then stop

K is the scancode of the key you want to test for ( eg. space is 57 )
