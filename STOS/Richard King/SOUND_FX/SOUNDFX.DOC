   About SoundFX.
  ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
   'SoundFX' v1.5 is  an STOS accessory which allows complex sound effects
 to be created and saved for inclusion  into an  STOS program, providing a
 quick  and  easy  way  to  manipulate  the  sound  chip registers  and to 
 experiment  with the  sounds  which are  produced. Unlike  sampled  sound 
 effects  very  little memory  is  used and  the  effects use virtually no 
 processor time.
    SoundFX uses the XBIOS #32 'DOSOUND' routine in  the ST's ROM to  play
 the sound  effects, because  it  is  more  powerful than  the STOS  sound 
 commands. Sounds are stored in a program bank containing a sound  playing
 routine. To play a sound two parameters  must  be  passed  to the routine 
 using the AREG and DREG commands, and the routine executed with the  CALL
 command.

 Atari ST sound capabilities.
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
   The Atari ST contains a Yamaha YM-2149 sound chip  which possesses  the
 following characteristics-
 3 separate frequency generators,
 1 noise generator,
 15 different volume/amplitude levels,
 16 pre-programmed envelopes.
   The chip contains 16 hardware registers but only 14 of  these, numbered
 from  0  to  13,  control  the  sound produced. Each  register, with  the 
 exception of register 129, uses only 1 byte of information-
 Register 0 provides fine control of the frequency for voice 1.
 Register 1 provides coarse control of the frequency for voice 1.
 Register 2 As register 0 but for voice 2.
 Register 3 As register 1 but for voice 2.
 Register 4 As register 0 but for voice 3.
 Register 5 As register 1 but for voice 3.
 Register 6 provides control of the pitch of the noise generator.
 Register 7 is the control register-
 Bit 0: Play pure note on voice 1 ON/OFF (1 for ON, 0 for OFF),
 Bit 1: Voice 2 Tone ON/OFF,
 Bit 2: Voice 3 Tone ON/OFF,
 Bit 3: Play Noise on voice 1 ON/OFF (1 for ON, 0 for OFF),
 Bit 4: Voice 2 Noise ON/OFF
 Bit 5: Voice 3 Noise ON/OFF
 Register 8  controls  the  volume  of voice 1. If  it  is  set  to 16 the
 envelope generator is being used.
 Register 9 As register 8 but for voice 2.
 Register 10 As register 8 but for voice 3.
 Register 11 provides fine control of the length of the envelope.
 Register 12  provides  coarse  control  of  the  length  of  the 
 envelope.
 Register 13 provides control of the envelope type.
 The Atari ST also  provides  3 software  registers  which  can  only  be 
 accessed with the XBIOS #32 routine-
 Register 128 sets the starting value of the register.
 Register 129-
 Byte #1 sets the register to change,
 Byte #2 sets the step size of the change,
 Byte #3 sets the end value of the register.
 Register 130 is a delay count. If set  to 0  the XBIOS  #32 routine  will 
 stop processing the sound data, if it is set to  any  other value it will
 be used as a delay count, halting further processing until the delay  has
 elapsed.

 Using SoundFX.
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
  SoundFX can be used as an STOS BASIC program, using 'load"Soundfx.acb"',
 an STOS accessory, using 'accload"Soundfx.acb"', or a stand alone program
 by clicking on the 'soundfx.prg' icon on the desktop. SoundFX only  works
 on a colour monitor ( medium res), and requires about 80k of memory  free
 when loaded.
  Options are chosen using the STOS menu system and by  clicking  on areas
 of the screen-
 Menu Options.
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
  There are 5 menu headings-
 Heading-'SoundFX'
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
   This  menu  contains  only  one  option, 'Information', which shows the 
 program version number.
 Heading-'File'
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
   This allows the loading and saving  of sound banks, using the STOS file
 selector,and contains options to quit and to quit and grab the sound bank 
 into the program which is being edited. This  last  option is only active
 when Soundfx is being used as an STOS accessory.
 Heading-'Input'
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
  This menu contains 5 options which allow the various components  of  the
 sound to be altered. When using  the  selectors  for  setting  frequency,
 volume etc. clicking on the '+' and '-' buttons will increase or decrease
 the setting slowly if the left button is pressed, quickly  if  the  right 
 button is pressed and very quickly if both buttons  are pressed. Clicking
 on the number between the two  buttons will allow a  number  to  inputted 
 directly from the keyboard.  
 Option 1-'Set Volume'
   This option allows the volume on each voice to  be set. The volume  can 
 range from 0 to 15, with 0 being silent and 15 being very loud.The volume 
 setting isn't used if the envelope is on.
 Option 2-'Set Noise'
   This allows the frequency of the  noise generator to be set  and ranges
 from 0 to 31, with 0 being the highest frequency and 31 the lowest.
 Option 3-'Set Frequency'
   This allows the frequency of the tone produced by each voice, which can
 range from 0 to 4095. 0 is the highest frequency and 4095 the lowest.
 Option 4-'Set Envelope Speed'
   The speed of the envelope can be set from 0 to 65535, with 0 being  the
 fastest and 65535 the slowest.
 Option 5-'Set Envelope Type'
   16 different envelope types/shapes can be selected from this option.
 Option 6-'Set XBIOS #32'
   This allows the XBIOS #32 interrupts, the R128/129/130 commands, to  be
 set. The topmost number sets which sound chip register will  be  affected
 by the routine and can  range from 0-13. The following figures define the 
 start and end value of that  register ( ranging from 0-255 ) and the step
 size of the  change ( -128 to +127 ). Care  should be taken when changing
 the value of register number 7 because this is also used by the ST's disk
 system. 
    The last number sets the register #130 count. If this is set  to 0  the
 XBIOS routine will stop processing  the  sound list, but  if it is set to 
 any other value it will be used as a delay, resuming processing the sound
 data list when the delay has  elapsed. Therefore the  next sound  in  the 
 sound bank will be played, which could  be useful  for  creating  effects 
 with 2 or 3 parts. However, a register #130 value  of 0 should be used in
 the last sound  in  the  bank to  prevent the routine from processing the 
 memory after the sound bank, which could result in a crash. 
 Heading-'Options'
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
 Option 1-'Play Current Sound'
   This plays the sound which is being edited.
 Option 2-'Play From Bank'
   This allows any of the sounds in the sound  bank to  be played. If  the
 sound selected to be played contains a  register #130 value other  than 0
 the next sound in the bank will be played after the delay has elapsed.
 Option 3-'Stop Sound'
   This stops the sound playing and resets the sound chip registers.
 Option 4-'Print Parameters'
   This sends a list of all the sound settings and  the  sound name to the
 printer.
 Option 5-'Randomize'
   This option randomizes  all  of  the  sound chip  variables, creating a 
 random sound effect.   
 Heading-'Bank'
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ  
 Option 1-'Get Sound'
   This allows a sound to be grabbed from the bank. The selector  displays
 8 pages of 32 sounds  each, with  each  page  being accessed by  clicking
 on the relevant number at the bottom of the selector.Clicking on the word
 'Cancel' aborts the operation.
 Option 2-'Put Sound'
   This puts a sound into the bank, using the same  selector  as  the  get 
 sound option.
 Option 3-'Delete Sound'
   This deletes a sound  from  the  bank, not operating if there is only 1 
 sound in the bank.
 Option 4-'Insert Sound'
   This option  inserts a  space after  the sound chosen, if the number of 
 sounds in the bank is less than 256.
 Option 5-'New Bank'
   A new sound bank can be created, with 1 to 256 sound  entries. The  old
 bank is destroyed so should be saved to disk beforehand.
 Option 6-'Grab from Program'
   This option displays a window  detailing any sound banks in  memory and 
 the number of sounds contained  in the bank. Only banks stored in  bank 8
 are recognized. Clicking on the relevant bank number grabs that bank into
 the accessory. This  option is  only active when SoundFX is being used as 
 an STOS accessory.
             ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
  The area under the menu bar shows all of the sound settings in graphical
 form, the sound name, and the values in the sound chip  registers. It  is
 possible to change the volume, noise, tone etc. settings  by clicking the
 mouse on the appropriate  graph, and the  sound  name  can be changed  by
 clicking on it and typing in the new name.

 Playing sounds from within an STOS BASIC program.
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
   A sound bank can be loaded into an STOS BASIC program by  either  using
 the 'quit and grab' option from within the SoundFX accessory, or by using
 the'reserve'command to reserve a bank of the correct length for the sound
 bank file and loading  the file  into the  bank with  the  command 'bload 
 >filename<,start(banknumber)'. The SoundFX accessory grabs  banks to  and
 from bank 8, so it is a good idea to load the sound file into this bank.
   To play a sound, two registers  must be  set using  the  AREG ( address 
 register) and  DREG ( data register)  commands. The 'areg' command  tells 
 the sound playing routine at the start of the bank where the start of the 
 sound data is located, and so should be set to  the  start  of  the  bank 
 number+60.
   The 'dreg'command tells the routine which sound number to play. Finally
 the routine is executed with the CALL command. Both the areg and the dreg
 commands  should  be  used to set  register  number 0. It is important to 
 specify  the  address and  sound number  correctly, as not doing so could 
 result in a bus or address error. Finally, the key click should be turned
 off with the 'click off' command and  if music is  playing it  should  be
 frozen with the 'music freeze' command before a sound effect is played. 
 Demo listing-
 10 reserve as data banknumber, length
 20 bload "filename.sbk", start(banknumber)
 30 areg(0)=start(banknumber)+60
 40 dreg(0)=soundnumber
 50 call banknumber

 Structure of the SoundFX bank.
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
  Each sound effect bank contains a 60 byte sound effect player program at
 the  beginning  of  the  bank, followed  by  a  12  byte header, an array 
 containing a 16 byte entry for each sound effect and 36 bytes of data for
 each effect.
 The Header.
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
  This is  made up of three longwords containing the identification number 
 of the bank (used by the grab from program option), the number of effects
 in the bank and the length of the sound data ( including the header,array
 and sound data list).
 The Array.
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
  Each sound effect  contains a 16 byte entry in the array. The first four 
 bytes of  each  array  entry is a longword containing the offset from the 
 start of the  header to the  beginning of the effect data (in bytes). The 
 next two bytes is a word containing the size of the sound data (36 bytes)
 and the remaining 10 bytes  is the ten character name string.
 Sound Effect Data.
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
  Each sound effect is made up of 36 bytes  of  information. The  first 28 
 bytes is made up of the data for the hardware registers and the remaining 
 data is for the r128/129/130 registers ( the r129 command uses 4 bytes).
  The data is arranged in memory with the register number followed by  the
 register value.
