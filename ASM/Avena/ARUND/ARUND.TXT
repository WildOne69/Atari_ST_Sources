during a lull while developing the next big demo i decided to
port some code found on come.to/amiga to the falcon. in fact i
lost the original code so ended up doing it myself, and it ended
up so small that there was even space for some "design" (the
basic effect fits into 128 bytes _including_ the header!)

the original was part of a coding competition to code the water
effect main loop as small as possible. the compo was won by
Azure, a brilliant Amiga coder. this routine is bigger because it
clips values so it looks nicer on screen. i think everyone who
entered the compo ended up with the same basic code anyway.
this code is pretty sloppy and there are loads of places to save
the odd byte.

not as good as the escape and checkpoint 128tros, but quite pretty.
i haven't tested it on vga yet.

in a weak attempt at literary humour the demo is called
"Arundhati Roy". i shall leave it up to you to find out why.

LARDARSE.TOS is a fat version that you can run from any resolution

ARUND030.TOS is the tiny one. there are still 6 free bytes!
	 it needs to be run in true colour, 320 pixel width.
         not tested on vga or old TOSses

ARUND1.S is the (devpac) source, so you can bastardize it. if you
         have a fast machine you can increase the display size,
         currently it's only 160x100
