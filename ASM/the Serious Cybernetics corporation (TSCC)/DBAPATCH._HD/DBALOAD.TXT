This loader was done to make the DBA-MAG 10 run from any directory and 
any drive. The program simply installs itself in the TRAP #1 vector,
catches all fopen and pexec calls and cuts the beginning of the path in
order to make it relativ to the maindirectory. 

For any questions or enhancements see the source written in assembler using
TurboAss 1.7. 

This piece of code is not responsible for the distorted displayer as it is
on my FALCON030 and
                 >>>  IT'S NOT PART OF THE DBA-DISKMAG  <<<



***** last minute changes:
I now managed to fix the bug with the textdisplayer which occured, when a
TV or RGB-Monitor is connected. The program now catches XBIOS(89), too,
and returns the value 1 which means VGA (even when a TV is connected).

I fixed that bug right after I upped the Mag, sorry. 


-> The source is freeware :-)
