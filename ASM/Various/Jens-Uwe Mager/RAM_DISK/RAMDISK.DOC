/* RAM	DISK ACCESSORY
   version 1.1 - sept 10, 1985, by Gert Slavenburg, Mountain View, CA.
	for 1Mbyte Atari ST

   version 1.1a - sept 11, 1985, mod. by Gyorgy Fekete, College Park, MD.

   version 1.1a is almost identical to Gert's original posting.
   I merely changed some parameters around to let 512K ST owners
   get the benefit of a ramdisk. This one is a 97K ramdisk. I tried
   128K on a 512 ST, but it bombs when you run the C compiler and you
   dont punt aes -- Gyorgy 
   PS: the rest of the program is pretty much as before, except
       for the commented changes.

   Link this program with accstart,%1,osbind,vdibind,aesbind
   This is the first, experimental version of the RAMdisk. It should
   be installed as a DESK ACCESSORY on the Bootdisk. Before re-booting,
   and thus activating it, the menu entry "install disk" should be used
   to install drive "D" with icon-label "RAMDISK".
   Then re-boot end enjoy.

   known bugs :
   1) diskette copy to/from the RAMdisk doesn't work. Don't know why,
      since the BPB's are identical.
   Lots of fun - Gert
