   You can use the RAMD97 program to create a 97K ramdisk.  The steps to
   do so are as follows:

   Step 1: Format a blank diskette and copy your original TOS disk to
   this.

   Step 2: Delete DESK1.ACC and DESK2.ACC (and SAMPLE.PRG if you like).

   Step 3: Copy RAMD97 from this disk to your newly formatted TOS disk.

   Step 4: Rename RAMD97 to be DESK1.ACC  (Use the SHOW INFO option).

   Step 5: Click on drive A.

   Step 6: Choose OPTIONS.  Choose INSTALL DISK DRIVE.  Make the drive
   identifier D.  Make the icon label RAMDISK.  INSTALL this drive.

   Step 7: Move the new drive D to wherever you want it on your desktop.

   Step 8: Save the new desktop.

   Step 9: Reboot your system.  The RAMDISK will be installed
   automatically as Drive D.

   NOTE: While you are on the desktop, this program will "beep"
   approximately every 30 seconds to remind you that the RAMDISK has been
   installed.
