     RamDisk 1040 is a self-allocating Memory Disk driver for the Atari ST with
at least 1 Megabyte of RAM. If you have a standard 520ST, this program will not
install a RamDisk.

     Name this program "RAMDISK.ACC" (or anything ".ACC") and keep it on your
TOS boot disk. To initially install the RamDisk, select a disk icon on the
desktop then select INSTALL DISK DRIVE from the Options Menu. Enter "D" for the
Disk identifier and "RAM DISK" for the disk name. Click the Install button and
a new disk icon will appear on the desk top. Go to the Options menu again and
select Save DeskTop to make this icon permanent (make sure you have your TOS
boot disk in drive A when saving the desktop).

     After re-booting your computer, you will have a 360K RamDisk allocated and
automatically installed on the DeskTop. To verify that the RamDisk is
allocated, go to the Desk menu bar and select "RAM Disk Info...". The desk
accessory will simply open a window showing the status. Click on the close
button to exit the RamDisk status window.

     RamDisk 1040 uses memory above the initial 512K of the standard 520ST.
Since a few applications use lower memory without concern for RamDisks, this
RamDisk will work with most of these applications (such as ST-Talk and other
programs written with 4XForth). Also, RamDisk 1040 will work with other
RamDisks, such as MichTron's M-Disk, with no apparent problems. Just allocate
some more memory under a different drive ID and have a second, smaller RamDisk.
Remember to keep it small (under 50K with no additional desk accessories) in
order to work with ST-Talk and other 4xForth applications.

     Here's some features that will be included in future releases:

    o  Smaller RamDisk automatically installed on 512K ST's.
    o  Ability to de-allocate/re-allocate from the desk accessory window.
    o  Option to automatically copy a disk into the RamDisk at boot time.
    o  Better use of RAM for ROM version of TOS (it works wierd with it now).

     If you have any problems or suggestions, leave me a message on CompuServe
or our BBS. I hope you lucky 1-Meg ST owners find this useful!
