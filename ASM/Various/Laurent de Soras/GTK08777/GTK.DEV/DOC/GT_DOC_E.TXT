I) GRAOUMF TRACKER...??? WOTIZDIS ?¨?
======================================

            Graoumf Tracker (pronounce 'Graoumf Tracker'...) is a
        soundtracker. It uses sampled sounds to reproduce musical
        instruments, and modules to obtain different notes.
        This is mainly what a 'SOUNDTRACKER' is.
            Before getting further, I have to say something important.
        The GT version you have here is a demonstration limited
        version, if you're not a registered user, of course, because
        GT is SHAREWARE.

        For further informations, see paragraph 'Shareware!!!'.

            You must at least have the following files, all in the
            same directory :
                - GTRACKER.PRG      The program
                - FILE_ID.DIZ       Short descripton, for BBS
                - READ_ME!.TXT      Read this first!

                -   GT_DOC_E.TXT    That's OK, you have it.
                -   WHATSNEW.TXT    Text showing the evolution of the
                                    successive versions of the
                                    program.

            It may be possible that a few TOS 4.01 owners may have
        problems by starting the program, because of the resolution
        change. Otherwise, there's no maximal limit for the
        resolution, you can start GT in 1664x592 if you want, no
        problem. For TV owners, a small part of the screen may be
        invisible, because of the overscan. If it happens, set the
        overscan option OFF by starting GT. (please remember that
        the Falcon knows that your monitor is a TV if nothing
        is plugged on the video port.
        So you can set the Overscan OFF by plugging the video port off
        while starting, and replug it later. In fact, the ideal
        resolution is 832x304 (obtained in RVB with my modified
        version of Falcon Screen 2.2á, by Nullos//DNT Crew). There are
        10 voices on-screen (8 voices with the volume) and the number
        of lines is high enough to compose and not slow down the
        displays too much.





II) GLOBAL USE
==============

1) G‚n‚ralities
===============

            GT works mainly as the other soundtrackers, the ones who
        are used to this will not be too disappointed. For those who
        aren't used to this kind of software, let me explain you that
        a music is composed of many 'patterns', small sequences that
        follow each other, to form a music. These patterns are
        composed of 'voices' (tracks), each voice playing only one
        instrument (and not two simultaneously). Patterns are also
        composed of 'lines', which scroll with the music. On these
        lines you find notes.
            In a pattern, notes are represented by numbers and letters
        organised in the following order:

                                   NNN II EEEE (VV)
                                    /   |   \    \__Volume
                                Note    |    Effect
                                    Instrument

            NNN is the note, with the octave number. The notation is
        English. The octave can take the values from 0 to 7, o is the
        lowest value. A null note is represented by ---. A note is
        played until the next note (on the same voice), or until an
        effect cuts it.
            II represents the number of the played instrument. It
        usually follows a note, but this is not necessary. In fact, it
        changes the number of the current instrument and sets the
        volume for the voice, the finetune and the panning of this
        instrument. 0 makes no change.
            EEEE stands for the effect you apply to the sound in the
        voice. These effects are diverse, and are used to make a
        change of note for example, or to modify the volume. For full
        description of these effects, see further.
            VV stands for the note's volume, 0 makes no change.
        But for more clearness, this volume may not be always
        displayed. (see key Ctrl+E), but it is always active.



2) Instruments and samples
==========================

            The instruments used by GT are composed of samples
        (digitised sounds). Instruments and samples are independant,
        an instrument may use many samples, and a sample may be used
        by many different instruments.
            If an instrument uses many samples, these ones will be
        played depending of the tone of the note, so that you could
        play a great number of octaves without any problems.
            Samples may be 8 or 16 bits, their frequency between 2
        and 65 KHz, and they can have their own panning settings. Of
        course it is possible to make them loop at the end, to make
        them longer without memory consumption.



3) Effects
=============

            There are a few ones... Every values are hexa-decimal.
        I do know that this is not very easy-to-use, but it allows
        you to use ALL the possibilities of the soundtracker, keeping
        a good compatibility with other formats.

        01xx    Portamento up
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Increases the note's frequency. xx is the speed of
                the effect. If this parameter is null, the last
                non-null parameter will be taken.

        02xx    Portamento down
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Lowers the note's frequency. xx is the speed of
                the effect.

        03xx    Tone portamento
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Allows you to link 2 notes, at the xx speed. If xx = 0,
                The parameter of the last tone portamento pr‚c‚dent
                is taken.
                Example:
                        C-2 1 ....
                              ....
                        D-2 1 .306
                              .303
                              .300
                              .300
                    While D2 , because of the Tone P., the note is
                not played, but the sound mais le son increases as
                for a classical portamento . At the next line , the
                speed is changed. And at the next line,
                the speed is not null but the last parameter is taken.
                When the sounds reaches the D2 frequency, the effect
                is finished. 03xx must be repeated as many times as
                necessary, so that the link can be done.

        04xy    Vibrato
                ~~~~~~~
                    Modulates a note's frequency. x the speed (the
                bigger x is, the fastest the vibrato is) and y the
                amplitude.
                If x or y are null, the parameters of the last command
                are taken.

        05xx    Tone portamento + Vibrato
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Mix of the Tone P. and the vibrato. The parameter
                xx is for the Tone portamento. The vibrato's parameter
                is the last used. Example:
                        C-2 1 .482      Vibrato with speed 8 and amplitude 2
                              .400      The vibrato goes on
                        D-2 1 .502      Link at speed 2, the vibrato
                        goes on
                              .500      The vibrato and the link go on
                              .500

        06xy    Vibrato + Tone portamento
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   Idem, but xy is the parameter for the vibrato.

        07xy    Tremolo
                ~~~~~~~
                    Modulates a note's volume. x is the speed (the
                bigger x is, the fastest the tremolo is) and y is the
                amplitude. The volume cannot be over 100. As usually,
                the parameters of the last command are taken if x or
                y are null.

        08xy    Detune
                ~~~~~~
                    Modifies a note's frequency immediately.
                        x : Fr‚quency +
                        y : Fr‚quency -
                    x et y allow you to modify of about 2/2
                tone. (-16...-8...0...+8...+15)

        09xx    Note delay
                ~~~~~~~~~~
                    Wiats during xx frames (1/50 second) before
                playing the note. If xx>speed, the note is not played.
                Example:

        0Axx    Cut note/Key off
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Cuts the note (setting the volume to 0) after
                waiting during xx frames. If an envelope was
                attributed to the sound,
                the 'Key off' part of this envelope will be executed.

        0Bxx    Jump to position
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Goes to position xx of the song. This effect was used
                by the Amiga Protracker to loop a music.

        0C0x    Set vibrato waveform
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Sets the wave form of the vibrato:
                        0       Sinuso‹d (default)
                        1       Triangular
                        2       Square

        0Dxx    Break pattern
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    The line where this effect is is the last played
                    line of the pattern. Then the music is played at
                    line xx of the pattern of the next position.

        0E0x    Set tremolo waveform
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Same as 0C0x, for the tremolo.

        0Fxx    Set global speed/Tempo
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        00 - 1F : Sets the number of frames (1/50 sec)
                                  for a pattern line. The length of a
                                  frame is re-initialised to 1/50 sec
                                  , not one more or less.
                                  The tempo is then equal to
                                  750/xx.
                        20 - FF : Tempo, the length of a frame to
                                  obtainthe correct tempo value.
                                  The error is ñ0.1 %, what is quite
                                  precise.

        10xy    Arpeggio
                ~~~~~~~~
                    Quickly transposes the note of x and y semi-tones.
                The arpeggio runs with 3frames cycles, the 1st is
                always the original note, the 2nd the note + x
                semi-tones, and the 3rd the note + y semi-tones.
                Example :

                         C-2 1 1047     C2 + 4 semi-tones : E2
                               1047     C2 + 7 semi-tones : G2
                    This effect will successively play C, E et G, to
                simulate a major C accord with strange 'gloogloos'

        11xx    Fine portamento up
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Th eportamento begins at the start of line,
                instead of the start of the frame, allowing lower
                speeds than those allowed by 01xx. Null parameter :
                continue the effect

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        13xy    Roll + Volume slide
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Quickly repeats the note to simulate a 'rolling'.
                Y is the period of the rollings (in frames), and x
                the modification of the volume for each roll :
                        0       No volume change

                        5       -16
                        6       2/3 of precedent volume
                        7       1/2 of precedent volume
                        8       No change

                        E       3/2 times the precedent volume
                        F       2 times the precedent volume
                Roll example:

                        demisemiquavers
                              13E0      The volume continues
                              increasing of 3/2

        14xx    Linear volume slide up
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Linear modification of the volume. xx is the speed
                of increase. Null parameter : effect goes on.

        15xx    Linear volume slide down
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        16xx    Exp. volume slide up
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Modifies the volume exponentially at speed xx.
                The difference with linear volume increase is that the
                volume is not only increased, but multiplied, what
                gives more realistic volume increases.

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        2xxx    Set linear volume
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Sets the volume of a note, linearly (from 0 to
                100).

        3xxx    Set exp. volume
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Idem, but the volume is exponantially set.
                800 correspond to 100, 700 to 80, 600 to 40,
                etc... The volume is multipied by 2 every 100.

        4xxx    Set balance
                ~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Sets the position of a note in the left-right
                stereo position. The 000 value sets the voice on the
                left, 800 in the middle (mono), and FFF on the right.
                Every value between those ones are accepted to set the
                sound anywhere in stereo.

        5xxx    Set linear master volume
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Allows you to set the general volume for every
                voices. Usually, it is equal to $3000 / (3 + number of
                voices). But as the full sound power is nearly never
                used, you can increase this level. But if
                'crackles' appear, set the value lower.

        6xxx    Set exp. master volume
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Same as the precedent, but the volume is
                exponantially set. 1000 corresponds to 1000 and 800
                to 40 (for linear values).
                The volume is divised by 2 every 155.

        7xyy    Roll
                ~~~~
                    Repeats a sample to simulate a roll.
                        x        Speed (period)
                        yy       Max. number of repeats
                    Roll must be repeated as many times as necessary.
                    If yy = 00, the number of rolls is unlimited. If
                    the speed after another roll is 0, the roll is
                    continual (so the first repetition is not
                    necessarly on the start of the note). Example :

                        C-2 1 7300 80   Plays 4 demisemiquavers
                              7000 A0   You can also increase the
                                        volume
                              7400 C0   Plays 3 semiquavers in triplets
                              7000 E0
                        C-2 1 .... FF

        8zxy    Roll + Volume slide + Set balance
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Similar to Roll + Volume slide (13xy), but the
                first number of the parameter (z) sets the new panning
                (0..8..F). Example, for a roll on toms:

                        C-3 1 8602      high Tom aigu on the left, in
                                        triplet
                              8600
                        A-2 1 8A03      medium Tom on the right,
                                        demisemiquavers
                              8A00
                        F-2 1 8C03      low Tom 100% on the right
                              8C00

        9xxx    Sample Offset
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Plays the sample from the xxx * 256 position.
                This effect is quite interresting for on one hand, it
                allows you to make subtle variations on a same sample,
                what makes the music more 'alive'. On the other hand,
                by setting little numbers as parameters, you can play
                the same instrument on 2 different voices, with the
                same note, giving the illusion that there are two
                instruments that play and not only one with a higher
                volume.

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        A8xx    Set number of frames
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Changes the number of frames per note, a little
                like Set Global Speed 0Fxx, but the length of each
                frame is not changed.

        A9xx    Set fine speed
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    This is the opposite of the precedent function,
                it allows you to change the length of a frame
                without changing the number of frames.de la fonction pr‚c‚dente, elle permet de

        AAxx    Pattern delay
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    The line where GT finds this effect is repeated xx
                times. The notes are only played one time at the
                beginning, but the effects still have their
                influence. It may be useful when you accelerate at a
                moment in the pattern, and you want to finish it
                correctly by compensating the number of lines.

        ABxx    Extra fine tone portamento
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        B0xy    Tremor
                ~~~~~~
                    Adds jerks in the note. It is a periodic effect :
                the volume is normal during x frames, then the note
                is cut during y frames.

        B1xx    Pattern loop
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Loops a part of a pattern. A B100 sets the start
                of the loop, and B1xx sets the number of times the
                pattern will be repeated between this last instruction
                and the B100.
                    You can add loops in the loops, but you have to
                use a different voice for each loop. Otherwise, the
                loops must be 'logically' set ... Example :
                        C-2 1 B100    | E-2 1 ....      Start of the
                                       first loop
                              ....    |       ....
                        G-2 1 ....    |       B100      Start of the
                                   second loop
                              ....    |       ....
                        B-2 1 ....    |       ....
                              ....    |       B102      Repeat 2 times
                              ....    | G-1 1 ....      loop 2 (3 passages)
                              B103    |       ....      and 3 times
                                                        loop 1 (4 passages)

        B2xx    Set flags
                ~~~~~~~~~
                    Activates or desactivates a few options. Add every
                options you want to activate to obtain the value xx to
                set in this effect. Don't forget it's hexadecimal !

4) envelopes
============

            Many envelopes can be attributed to each instrument.
        These envelopes (there are three kinds : volume, tone and
        panning), allow you to modify the sound of an instrument
        without having to use effects in the score. For example, you
        want to apply a vibrato to an instrument, each time this one
        is played. Yes, you can do it in the score (4xx command), but
        this is boring to set for each note, and it prevents you to
        use other effects in the same time. There comes the tone
        envelope : you just have to assign a tone envelope to the
        instrument with a vibrato, and it makes it !

            But these are not the only advantages of the envelopes :
        you can change the parameters all along the sample, thanks to
        a kind of language, used to describe the envelope. Moreover,
        when a note (in the score) stops (key off), you can define a
        second envelope to describe the way the sound is cut ! Of
        course, it is possible to use the three kinds of envelopes at
        the same time.


    a) Commands for the 3 kinds of envelopes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        End             The envelopes ends here, it is not effective
            anymore, after this command. The volumes,
            periods or pannings are let as they were set
            before this command. The tremolos, tremors or
            vibrato are stopped.

        Jump to         Jumps to the specified command number.

        Wait            Waits during a number of 'ticks' before
            getting on with the commands. If increases or
            lowerings of parameters have been set, they
            will be regularly done during this wait time.


        Set Counter     Sets the loop counter to 0. You must put this
            instruction before each loop to set how many
            times the group of commands must be executed.

        Loop to         Jumps to the asked position, and substracts 1
            to the loop counter. When the counter is 0,
            there's no jump anymore.

        Key Off         When GT meets this command, the 'key off'
              part of the envelope is executed.

            An envelope must always end with a 'End' (...), a Key Off
        or a Jump (loop without end). Moreover, it must contain Waits,
        for the time is spent during the Waits, and then the sound can
        continue, for the other commands do not modify directly the
        sound.


    b) Volume envelope
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            This kind of envelope modifies everything about the volume
        of a sound : general volume, tremolo and tremor. If you have
        a volume envelope for an instrument, and volume settings in
        your score, the envelope will modify the volume so that the
        two settings are executed. It's the same thing for every
        envelope settings.
            The volume envelope is composed of a lot of commands,
        here thay are :

        Volume          Attributes a new volume to the envelope. The
            normal volume is 4000 (16384 in hexa), but it
            is possible to enter values like 7FFF.

        Vol Step        It's the step for the increasing or lowering
            of the volume.

        Vol Speed       Every xx 'ticks', the volume will be increased
              (or lowered) by the value fixed with Vol Step.

        Tremolo On      Activates the tremolo

        Tremolo Off     Desactivates the tremolo

        Trem Width      Sets the tremolo's amplitude. Be careful,
            this time the scale of the volume is from 0 to 100.

        Trem Speed      Speed of the tremolo

        Tremor On       Activates the tremor (swapping between sound on/sound cut)

        Tremor Off      Desactivates the tremor

        TremorTime1     Sets the number of 'ticks' during which the sound is
            on.

        TremorTime2     Sets the number of 'ticks' during which the
            sound is off.


            At the beginning of the envelope, in part Attack, the
        volume is initialised to 4000, the step 0, the speed 0, and
        tremor times 3.

    c) Tone envelope
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            With this kind of envelope, you can modify everything
            about the frequency of the note.

        Set Tone        Sets the period of the note. The scale is
            1000. With 2000, the note is lowered of 1
            octave, with 800 it is increased of 1 octave.


        Tone Step       Sets the step of the period variation

        Tone Speed      Sets the speed of variation

        Vibrato On      Activates the vibrato

        Vibrato Off     Desactivates the vibrato

        Vib Width       Amplitude of the vibrato

        Vib Speed       Speed of vibrato

    d) Panning envelope
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            Modification of the stereo position of the instrument.

        Panning         Sets the panning: 000..800..FFF

        Pan Step        Sets the panning variation step

        Pan Speed       Sets the speed of variation

    e) Example envelope
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            The envelope language is simple, powerful, but not very
        easy to understand for beginners. So, this is an example, for
        a tone envelope :

                0   Vibrato On
                            The vibrato set 'on'
                1   Vib Width 06
                            Depth of the vibrato: 6
                2   Vib Speed 18
                            Speed of the vibrato: 18 (fast)
                3   Wait 50
                            Until now, commands 0,1 and 2 were
                        executed in the same time, in the same frame.
                        Now, the tracker stops during 50 frames (about
                        1 sec), and will execute the vibrato.

                4   Vibrato Off
                            Then you stop the vibrato.
                5   Tone Step 10
                6   Tone speed 3
                            Then we set the tone step to 10, and its
                        speed to 3. Please note that nothing has
                        happened to the sound yet. these three
                        commands were executed verrrrrry quickly.

                7   Wait 32767
                            Now, during 32767 frames (the maximum in
                        fact), the tone, set to 1000 (hexa) by
                        default, will increase of 10 every 3 frames.

                8   Jump to 7
                            Back to the precedent Wait, we have a
                        loop without end. If we only had ended by End
                        instead of Wait + Loop, the sound would not
                        have changed since the end of the vibrato and
                        the last commands wouldn't have had any
                        effect.





III) NOTICE OF THE SOUNDTRACKER
===============================

            After loading GT, you see a screen divided into a few
        parts. The first part, in the lower part of the screen, is
        divided into some columns, you have a screen divided into many parts.
        The first part, in the lower part of the screen, is divided into a few
        columns. These are the voices of the soundtracker. Another part, on
        the top left, you see informations about the song (nuber of the
        pattern, loop position, etc.) and the active instrument. The part on
        the top right contains the main functions icons. Just below there are
        other icons and buttons, which correspond to a specific group of
        functions (disk, tools...). Then the central part gives a few
        informations : cut voices, disposition of the voices, current octave,
        free memory, etc.




1) The main functions
=====================

            Let's styart with the icons concerning the song. Each of them is
        followed by a number (hexa, base 16) and by two small arrows. By
        clicking on the upper arrow, you increase the number and on the other,
        you decrease it... A left click changes one unity by one, a right
        click changes it more quickly, and the two buttons pressed together,
        still faster. It's also possible to input the value directly with the
        keyboard, by clicking on the number.

    a) Left icons
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        POSITION        Indicates the current position in the song. A module
                        is composed of a succession of patterns. A pattern
                        number is associated to each position.

        PATTERN         This is the pattern number !

        LENGTH          Length of the song. The positions start from 0 to
                        length-1.

        REPEAT          Repeat position. When the song is finished, it is
                        re-started at the set repeat position.

        INSTR           The number of the current instrument. When you input a
                        note, it carries this number. If you click right on
                        this icon, the number of the instrument will be the
                        number of the current sample (see further) and the
                        current sub-menu will be in 'instrument' mode.


        SAMPLE          The number of the current sample. As for the precedent
                        icon, a right click replaces this number by the
                        current instrument number, and the sub-menu will be in
                        'Sample' mode.

    b) Top-pannel buttons
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        PLAY SONG       Plays the whole song, from the beginning of
                        the pattern if you click left, or from the
                        current line if you click right.

        PLAY PATTERN    Plays the current pattern in loop.
                        Differences as PLAY SONG for the mouse buttons.

        INSERT POS      Inserts a position in the song (list of
                        patterns), after the position set by
                        'Position'. If you click right, the new
                        pattern will be the first unused pattern
                        found. If this one is empty, it will be set to
                        64 lines (by default).


        DELETE POS      Deletes the current position from the song.

        EDIT            Switches in edition mode. Then you can modify
                        the current pattern.

        STOP            Stops the song.

        HELP            Summary of the main functions.

        SAMPLE EDITOR   Access to the samples editor.

        PREFS           Access to the preferences panel.

        ENVELOPES       Access to the envelopes sub-menu.

    c) Presets and Mute keys
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            About presets: to make the composition in many voices
        easier, I had to find a system allowing to easily navigate in
        the score, even if the number of played voices is bigger than
        the number of voices displayed on screen in the same time. In
        the middle of the screen, there's an icon PRESET, followed by
        a few numbers. By clicking on one of the numbers (one of the
        presets), you select which voices (tracks) will be displayed
        on screen, and which preset will be active. The number of each
        voice is displayed at the top of the columns. You can modify
        it with the arrows, or by entering their number on the
        keyboard.
         If you want to display only N columns, you just have to click
        right on the column number N. So you can set 32 voices
        configurations. You can use it to display a rythmic part, or a
        piano part, etc.

            Under the presets, there's another set of numbers, next to
        a 'ON/OFF' icon. They show which voices will be cut. To cut a
        voice, click left on the voice number, or on the voice itself.
        At the top of each voice, a round symbol shows which voice is
        active, a cross shows which voice is cut. If you click left on ON/OFF,
        all the voices are set ON. With the right button, you invert the state
        of all the voices. If you click right on the number of a voice, it
        will be set ON and all te others will be cut. Very useful to hear how
        a voice sounds in solo.


            The numeric pad has two functions : the first (Sample mode) is to
        choose the current sample by pressing one of the 16 keys of the
        numeric pad (except 0 and .). You can attribute a sample number to
        each key of the numeric pad, by pressing the key + right SHIFT. The
        number of the current sample will be registered in the defined key.
        Please note that with left SHIFT, you have access to 16 other samples.
            The second function is the drumpad. By pressing on one of the
        keys, you put in the score the note, instrument and effect
        attributed to this key. To register a note in the drumpad, put the
        mark on the note in the score, then press right SHIFT + key. Same note
        as precedent for left SHIFT. The drumpad is useful to enter in the
        score some instruments always using the same note, like percussions.



    d) A few icons left
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        NB OF VOICES/   These two icons indicate the number of voices and
                        lines used in each pattern. Click on them to change
                        one of the parameters.
        LINES           You can modify the number of lines for each
                        independant pattern, but the number of voices wil be
                        the same for EVERY patterns. GT asks you if you want
                        to keep the patterns (if the new parameters allow it),
                        or some voices will be deleted. With 'New Song', the
                        sequence will be deleted. If you click right on 'Lines
                        : xx', the length of the pattern will be automatically
                        set to 64 lines by default.


        STEP            Allow you to jump lines while inputing notes. The step
                        may be negative or null, for example to enter acords
                        (in combination with <TAB>).

        CHRONOMETER     Counts the time spent from the beginning of the music.        LE BOUTON       En cliquant en tout haut … gauche de l'‚

        SECRET BUTTON   By clicking in the top-left border of the screen, you
                        can exit Graoumf.



        NB: If a few icons don't have any effect when clicking on them, don't
        be disappointed, the function hasn't been included yet (but you won't
        have to wait for a long time 'till it is).

            Small note about the number of voices. Basically, GT is able to
        play up to 32 voices without problem. Youc could use more, but it
        depends on the frequency of the notes. The higher the frequency is,
        the less voices you can use. For example, 32 voices with only C-0
        works perfectly (even if it's not very interrestng...), but you won't
        be able to use every voices with B-4. When the limit is passed, the
        quality of the sound become debased. There will never be any crash of
        the soft, except on some accelerated FALCONS. But it is possible to
        prevent GT from having these problems, by decreasing the playback
        frequency (50 Khz by default), but you will have to pay this by
        decreasing the quality of the sound too.

            Finally, the icon to exit the programm doesn't appear, you have to
        click on the top left border to exit.



2) A few useful shortcuts

        CTRL + F2 : Copies the block (preset)
        ALT + F2 : Copies the block (the voice under the cursor)

        CTRL + D : Shows the processor time used. This shows an horizontal
        band that scrolls on the screen. By having a look at it, you see if
        you can add voices. The band mustn't cover the whole screen. (Note of
        the translator : then follows a french 'Play-on-Words', it is quite
        hard to translate in English so let me put here the original text :
                   "La bande ne doit pas envahir tout l'‚cran, o— alors vous
                   p‚ririez dans d'atroces souffrances que votre faible intel-
                   lect ne pourrait mˆme pas imaginer... oh l… je divague
                   (mais dix vagues c'est beaucoup pour un seul homme, hein?)".
        Well, for programmers and others, the red bands represent the
        processor time used by the 68030 + DSP and the blue bars show the time
        used by the DSP only.

        CTRL + E : Changes the width of the displayed voices. I explain:
                   usually, you can see in the score the note, its instrument
                   and its effect. But you can also see (and edit) the volume
                   commands, thanks to this key. Moreover, you can choose not
                   to display the effects, if you want to see more voices on
                   screen in the same time.


        CTRL + R : Changes replay frequency. By default the player is 50 Khz,
                   but you can set it to 32, 25, 20, 16 or 12 Khz.
                   This manipulation decreases the quality of the sound, but
                   it allows you to use the whole 32 voices and very high
                   frequency samples.


        CTRL + S : Increases the edition step, So that you could for example
                   input only quavers without pressing the down arrow all te
                   time.

         + SHIFT : Decreases the edition step. This tep may be null
                   , very useful in combination with the <TAB> key to create
                   accords, and it can even be negative.(for original
                   composers !)

        CTRL + I : Activates or desactivates the linear interpolation on the
                   voice that is under the cursor. This function allow you to
                   have a much better sound quality, especially with low
                   frequency digitised samples. But there is a light loss of
                   dynamic, due to the high frequencies that are filtered.
                   This function also takes much calculating time for the DSP,
                   that's why it is possible to activate it on the voices you
                   choose.

        CTRL + I + SHIFT : Activates/desactivates the interpolation on every
                           voices.

        ALT + L  : Loads a mod.
        ALT + S  : Saves a mod.

        ALT + M  : Followed by the 1,2, 4 or 5 key, this function sets the
                   overscan screen, which may be not centered on TVs.


        CTRL + ALT + P : Snapshot of the screen. After pressing these keys,
                   click on the borders in the top-left and in the
                   bottom-right of the part of screen to be snapshot. The
                   picture is then saved as SNAPxxxx.TGA.



3) Disk Menu
============

            It's the menu for files operations. A few icons :

        LOAD MOD        Loads a mod. If you click right, the module shown in
                        the path is automatically loaded.
                        Mod packed with aTOMIC 3.5 and PACK ICE 2.1 or 2.4 are
                        loaded.

        SAVE MOD        Saves a mod. Right button active. The mod may be only
                        saved in formats .GT2, .GTK, .S3M or .MOD.
                        If the mode is already on the disk, a backup file is
                        created (.BAK) to save the last version and prevent
                        from manipulation errors.
                        ( WARNING of the translator : on my FALCON (TOS 4.02,
                        40 Mhz, there's a disk error after saving or loading a
                        certain number of mods. This error will be very soon
                        deleted)

        LOAD PREF       Loads a preferences file.

        SAVE PREF       Saves a preferences file. The default loaded file is
                        GTKPREFS.INF.


        MODULE FILE     These are the formats Loded and/or saved by Graoumf.

        PATH OF...      Access path, with default file names.
        AUTOLOAD        This one is quite special. When starting, Graoumf
                        Tracker loads the mod and samples found in this
                        directory (if there are some). The musician can
                        prepare its set of instruments, to be able to compose
                        without having to look after the good samples for a
                        long time.

        MAKE DIR        Creates a new directory

        DEL DIR         Deletes a directory on the disk. It must be empty (the
                        directory, not the disk...)


        DEL FILE        Zabroof, no more file!

        RENAME          Hop, nobody's seen anything, I changed the name of the
                        file.

        FORMAT          Formats a HD disk  1.44 Mo or 1.6 Mo (or more).
                        ***not included yet***

            About the different save formats, you have to know that only the
        GT2 format is able to save everything correctly.
            The .GTK format takes every effects, but doesn't save the
        envelopes and the associated multi-samples instruments. Each
        instrument of the score is associated to the same number of sample.
            Then comes the .S3M. Same restrictions as for GTK, except that the
        full size of the mod mustn't exceed 1 Mo to be correctly loaded later.
        A few effects will also be lost, or their values arrounded, like
        panning slides, exponential volume, etc. Extreme octaves (6,7 and
        8) will be saved as they are but are not managed in the official
        format. Moreover, the format is theorically limited to 16 voices of
        sampled sound, even if it is possible to make 32.
            Finally the .MOD format, is limited by all these restrictions, but
        it's still worse ! The octaves go from 1 to 3. Many effects will be
        lost, especially the volume column, converted into Protracker's Cxx
        when possible (it doesn't have the priority on other effects). Every
        volume slides will be arrounded. The maximum samples number is 31 (1F
        in hexa). The samples whose number is superior to 31 will be put in
        the free places before this number. If there are more than 31 samples,
        they won't be saved. If the module is 4 voices / 64 lines, it is saved
        as a normal mod (ident. M.K.); if it's more than 4 voices it is saved
        in FastTracker format (id. xCHN); and if the number of lines is
        different than 64, it is saved in Digital Tracker's format (id. FAxx).




4) Tools Menu
=============

            Yes, again loads of buttons. Let's go :

        START           Sets the start of the block at the position of the
                        cursor. The voice, the pattern, the start and end of
                        the block are displayed in the central line (BLK
                        vv/pp:ss-ee).


        END             Sets the end of the block

        PASTE           Copies the bloc into the place where the cursor is.

        INSERT          Inserts the block inti the place where the cursor is.

        CLEAR           Deletes the block.

        DELETE          Deletes the block and puts what is after the block at
                        the ancient position of the deleted block.

        NOTE UP         Every notes of the block are increased from 1/2 tone

        NOTE DOWN       Toutes les notes du bloc sont baiss‚es d'un demi-ton.

        SWAP            Swaps between the block and the same length part under
                        the cursor.

        REPLACE/TRANSP  If transparency is active, while copying a block the
                        notes of the destination place won't be deleted if the
                        corresponding line of the block is empty.

        ALL/MASK        If MASK is active, the block operations use a MASK
                        (see further)

        TRACK/          Sets from what the block will be selected.
        PATTERN/
        PRESET

            There are two icons, called MASK ON and REPLACE BY, that concern
        the masking of the block. The first mask filters every notes. An
        ? means that there may be anything in this field. The second mask is a
        replacement mask. A ? means that the chosen input is let, or it will
        be replaced by the set value.
        Example: if MASK ON = C-2 1????, and REPLACE BY = G-3 41234, during a
        copy only the notes in C-2 of the instrument number 1 will be taken,
        and replaced by a G-3 of the instrument 4, with the effect 1234.
        EXT NOTE is also a replacement filter, but only for the effect of a
        note that has been input with the keyboard. For example, if EXT NOTE =
        0123, when a note will be input with the keyboard, the effect 0123
        will automatically follow it.

            To modify these masks, click on them and enter your values as in
        the score. 'SPACE' puts an empty note.


        CLEAR SONG      Deletes every patterns

        CLEAR INSTR     Deletes every samples

        CLEAR ALL       Deletes all !

        .../...         Next page, here it comes:

            In this second page of Tools menu, you can easily create echo
        effects, without modifying the samples, simply y modifying the volume.



        ECHO            Runs the echo effect. Each note of the concerned track
                        will be repeated with a drecreased volume.

        EVERY n LINES   Sets the time between each repeat.

        CONT            If this icon is active, the echo of a note will
                        continue, even after another note.

        FEEDBACK        In this mode, the percents represent the volume that
                        each repeat will have from the precedent.

        FADESTEP        Set how much the volume must decrease between each
                        repeat.

        VOLUME SLIDE    Makes a progressive volume increase or decrease
                        between two volume commands. The cursor must be
                        between these two ones. The volume column is used for
                        this effect. Example :

                            C-2 1 2030    Start volume     \   C-2 1 2030
                            D-2 1 ....    ==================\  D-2 1 .... 39
                            E-2 1 ....    | Click on         \ E-2 1 .... 42
                                  ....    | Volume Slide     /       .... 4B
                            F-2 1 ....    ==================/  F-2 1 .... 54
                            G-2 1 .... 5D End volume       /   G-2 1 .... 5D

        .../...         next page again:

            It's the page of the song. The left window represents all the
        positions with every associated patterns, and their names. Click left
        there to change the position in the sequence, and right to modify the
        name of the pattern.


        INSERT POS      Inserts a new position at the cursor.
                        If you click right, the new pattern will be the first
                        empty pattern met.

        DELETE POS      Deletes the position under the cursor.

        .../...         Back to 1st page of Tools menu.



5) Instruments Menu
===================

            Here you will be able to create your instruments, starting with
        loaded samples. The left window shows the repartition of the samples
        according to the notes. For you can have may samples for one
        instrument, so that you can play a great number of octaves without
        deteriorating the sound in the extreme high or low frequencies.

            The first column indicates the number of the sample, the second
        its name, the third the transposition (how many semi tones you want to
        change the original note to obtain the sample's note).
        Finally the fourth column is the note that corresponds to the sample.
        For example:
                        07 PIANO 1    C-0 +12
                        ...           ... ...
                        08 PIANO 2    C-2 +00
                        ...           ... ...
                        09 PIANO 3    C-4 -12
                        ...           ... ...
                        09 PIANO 3    G-8 -12
            Let's ay that this is instrument 5. When you will input a note
        with this instrument, a different sample will be played, according to
        the frequency of the note. If the note is between C-0 and B-1, it will
        be the sample 7, but 12 semi tones (1 octave) above the input note.
            If you had input G-0, GT would have played the sample 07 at note
        G-1. With a note between C-2 and B-3, the sample 8 is played at the
        note you input in the score (transpose 0), and between C-4 and G-8,
        the sample 9, decreased from 1 octave.

            In this list, the part where you can modify the characteristics is
        displayed in color red. This is now the description of the buttons, as
        usual :

        SAMPLE          Modifies the number of the selected part's sample.

        TRANSPOSE       Modifies the transpositon in semi tones of the sample

        GROUP           When this icon is active, every sample number changes
                        will be attributed to the whole group of note around
                        the cursor. If not, only the note under the cursor
                        will be modified.

        FROM / TO       Changes the space covered by the sample

        VOLUME          General volume of the instrument

        VOLUME/TONE/PAN Selection of envelope numbers for this instrument

        LIST            Gives access to the instruments list. Clcik on an
                        instrument to choose it.

        LOAD INSTRUMENT Loads an instrument and its samples, keeping the
                        samples attributed to the precedent instrument.

        LOAD & REPLACE  Loads an instrument with its samples. The specific
                        samples of the precedent instrument are deleted, and
                        the new ones are put in the first empty places found.
                        *** Not included yet ***

        SAVE INSTRUMENT Saves an instrument with all its samples



6) Samples Menu
===============

            In this menu, you can load and save your samples, or modify their
        characteristics. Let's describe the buttons and icons :

        SAMPLE          Number of the current sample. Next to it, you see its
                        name. Click on it to edit.

        VOLUME          The volume of the instrument, from 0 to FFF in hexa, 100
                        is the average value.

        LENGTH          Its length in octets

        REPEAT          Its loop point

        REPLEN          The length of the loop.

        FINETUNE        Sets how many 1/16 tones above/below the note the
                        instument must be played. Useful when samples are not well
                        accorded.

        FREQUENCY       Indicates the sample's frequency. By default at 8363
                        Hz, but if you load .AVR for example, the frequency of
                        the file will be taken.

        BITS            Choose the resolution of the sample (8 or 16 bits). To
                        change this resolution, click on this icon. Be
                        careful, if you swap from 8 to 16 bits, there will be
                        no difference; but if you swap from 16 to 8 bits you
                        earn memory but you lose quality (that will not be
                        restored by setting back to 16 bits).

        BALANCE         Automatic balance. If ??? is found there, the balance
                        of the voice where the instrument is played will not
                        be modified. If not, the voice will take the value set
                        as new balance. (800 = mono)


        KILL            Deletes the current sample

        LOAD            Loads a sample. A right click loads the sample whose
                        name is in in the path of the Disk menu.
                        The sample may be packed with ATOMIC 3.5, ICE PACKER
                        2.1 or 2.4.

        SAVE            Saves the sample. A right click saves the sample in
                        the path of the Disk menu. The sample in saved in .AVR
                        format.

        SAMPLE FILE     Choice of the default extension.

        LIST            list of the samples. A small square next to the number
                        of a sample shows that this one is not empty.

        INSTRUMENT ?    Looks for the instrument which corresponds to the
                        current sample. If you click left, the search will
                        begin from the start, if you click right it will begin
                        from the current instrument. The found instrument
                        becomes then the current instrument.



7) Envelopes menu
=================

            This menu allows you to edit envelopes. The envelopes commands are
        found in the left window (the cursor is displayed as a ">"), and the
        list of commands in the right window. To insert a command at the
        cursor's positon, click on this command in the list. In the middle of
        all this you find a few buttons...


        VOLUME          Indicates the kind of envelope edited.
        TONE
        PAN

        ATTACK          Indicates the section of the envelope that is edited        KEY OFF
        KEY OFF         Attack is the normal envelope (when it begins), and
                        Key Off the envelope executed for the cut of the note
                        (with effect Note Cut)


        ENVELOPE        Shows the number of the current envelope, its name is
                        editable just below.

        CLR ENV         Sets the envelope to 0.

        DEL COM         Deletes the envelope command under the cursor

        COPY            Copies the envelope whose number is shown in the
                        edited envelope.



8) Control Menu
===============

            This part allows you to control the global volume, the tempo, the
        speed, the volumes and balances for each voice.

            Part of general and panning control:

        TEMPO           Tempo in BPM. Corresponds to the command 0Fxx.

        SPEED           Speed of a demisemiquaver (normal speed = 6).
                        Corresponds to command A8xx.

        RESET           Reset the balance. You can choose a mono sound,
                        L-R-R-L...-type sound, or semi-stereo sound (better
                        for headphones).

        01-08, 09-16,   Selects the 8 voices you want to modify the balance
        17-24, 25-32

        1, ..., 32      Balance for each voice. As usual, settings with the
                        keyboard of with the fader. Corresponds to command
                        4xxx.

        L, R            Global volume of left and right channels. It is
                        possible to input the values with the keyboard or to
                        move the fader with the mouse.

        M               Master volume of the soundtracker (the one set by
                        function 5xxx).

        RESET           Reset the volume of all the tracks to 0 dB. (command
                        C210 or C3C0).

        01-08, 09-16,   Selects the 8 voices you want to modify the volume
        17-24, 25-32

        1, ..., 32      Exponential volume for each voice, corresponds to
                        command C3xx. The window allows you to set the volume
                        from -12 dB to 6 dB. Setting with the fader only.



9) MIDI menu
============

            This part allows you to use a MIDI keyboard, a rythm box, or any
        MIDI instrument with GRAOUMF TRACKER. For the momet, GT only uses MIDI
        IN, only in polyphonic mode.

            The MIDI IN synchro allows to adjust the speed settings between GT
        and the MIDI instrument. That's very useful in RECORD mode.
            But for technical reasons, the sounds played by GT will be played
        about 1/20 Sec after the received signals. But in the score,
        everything's allright.

            Let's have a look at the icons of this menu :


        MIDI IN         With this function, Graoumf Tracker is able to play
                        and record notes that are coming from the MIDI port.

        MIDI OUT        Inactive for the moment.

        SYNC IN         Sets the external MIDI synchro on.

        SYNC OUT        Inactive for the moment.

        MONOPHONIC MODE Inactive for the moment.

        POLYPHONIC MODE The reception of notes is made on many tracks,
                        assigned to MIDI channels in the following sub-menu.

        CHANNEL         Inactive for the moment.

        INSTRUMENT      Inactive for the moment.

        P.M. CONF       Gives you the polyphonic mode configuration menu.

            In this sub-manu, there's a pannel on the right, showing the
        number of the MIDI channels attributed to each track.
             Click on the track number to give him or not a channel number,
        and click on the channel number with left or right buttons to increase
        or decrease this number.
        These are the icons on the left :


        MIDI CHANNEL    Shows the MIDI channel you are currently working on.
                        Clicks on arrows increase or decrease the number, and
                        click on the icon allow you to configure the channel.

        INSTRUMENT      Number of the instrument attributed to the channel.

        SELECT C. PRES. The channel is attributed to every tracks of the
                        current preset.

        REMOVE CHANNEL  Deletes every tracks which contain the number of the
                        channel.

        GENERAL CONF.   Back to the main MIDI menu.



10) Compatibility with other formats
====================================

            Even if Graoumf Tracker can load many different formats, the
        compatibility is not always perfect, because of the different concepts
        between soundtrackers.


        ProTracker .MOD and assimilate:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            It's the standard format, the compatibility is nearly perfect. The
        different versions of this format (FastTracker for example) are also
        loaded, in 4 voices or more. Only a few often unemployed effects were
        not included. This is the list of the compatible effects :


                0xx - Arpeggio                  E1x - Fine porta up
                1xx - Porta up                  E2x - Fine porta down
                2xx - Porta down                E4x - Set vibrato waveform
                3xx - Tone porta                E5x - Set finetune
                4xy - Vibrato                   E6x - Pattern loop
                5xy - Tone porta + Volume slide E7x - Set tremolo waveform
                6xy - Vibrato + Volume slide    E8x - Panning
                7xy - Tremolo                   E9x - Retrig sample
                8xx - Panning                   EAx - Fine volume slide up
                9xx - Sample offset             EBx - Fine volume slide down
                Axy - Volume slide              ECx - Note cut
                Bxx - Jump to position          EDx - Note delay
                Cxx - Set volume                EEx - Pattern delay
                Dxx - Break pattern
                Fxx - Set speed/tempo

            The Set glissando control (E3x) and Funk loop (EFx) lack.
        The commands 8xx et E8x are not eh original Protracker effects (Phasor
        effect for 8xx), for these ones are rarely used. Many soundtrackers
        changed it into Panning, so does Graoumf Tracker.


            Now the list of the known IDs :
                M.K. / M&K& / M!K! ................................ Protracker
                FLT4 / FLT6 / FLT8 / RASP ....................... StarTreckker
                xCHN / xxCH ...................................... FastTracker
                CD81 ........................................... Octalyser STE
                FAxx ..................................... Digital Tracker 030

        Format OctaMED Pro Amiga .MMD:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            This format is quite compatible, the Synth/Hybrid instruments are
        loaded too, but their envelopes and specific effects are not used up
        to now. As each pattern has its own length, a new track is created,
        containing a Break Pattern command.

        Format .669:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
            669 modules are usually well loaded. A 9th track is created for
        the independant speed and pattern-end commands.

        Format MultiTracker .MTM:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            The MTM format is correctly loaded.

        Format Scream Tracker 3 .S3M:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            No troubles with this format, the specificities of Scream Tracker
        3.2 are also taken. I think that GT is now the best soundtracker for
        loading S3M on the FALCON.

        Format Ultra Tracker .ULT:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            GT loads this format (versions V001 to V004), but as there are two
        effects for each note, I do the best I can : Cxx is put in the volume
        column, and the first effect has the priority on the second. The
        command number 5 is not used (that makes strange things on samples
        loops...).

        Format Digital Tracker .DTM:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            The compatibility is nearly perfect, except for stereo samples that
        are automatically converted in mono. The old .DTM mods are also
        loaded.

        Format Fast Tracker 2 .XM:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            For the moment, this format is not completely managed, everything
        about the envelopes are not taken. Anyway, you can load most of the
        modules without troubles, those ones rarely use envelopes.




11) Preference file GTKPREFS.INF
================================

            You can modify a few default parameters of the Graoumf Tracker,
        that are loaded as the programm starts, like the number of default
        tracks and lines, keyboard shortcuts, Sample editor's effects'
        parameters, etc.
            All these settings are saved in the GTKPREFS.INF file. It's a 100%
        ASCII file, so you can modify it with any text editor.


            The file is composed of two kinds of stuffs : settings and
        comments. These ones begin as ";", and end at the end of the line. You
        can do whatever you want after the ";" for the comment is not read by
        Graoumf. But it may help you for the settings we're going to talk
        about.


            The settings represent the main part of the file. They're composed
        of the name of a setting, specific to Graoumf Tracker, then a "=", and
        settings attributed to this entry.
            The format of these entries depend on the setting. Comments are
        added by the tracker to help you.


            To set the shortcuts, it's a little special. You find a 'keydef'
        before the name of the function whose shortcut you want to define.
        Then comes the name, then a setting, see further for more
        explanations.
        After the "=" you find the list of the keys you have to press to
        obtain the function you want. You can input :

            - Every letters (knowing that a few of these letters are used for
        the input of notes !!!),

            - The following keys: esc, tab, <, backspace, return, del, #,
        help, undo, ins, clr, up, down, left, right, pad0 and padpoint. You
        can only use one key for each function.

            - You may also attribute special keys to these keys, like
        lshift (left), rshift (right), shift (any),
        ctrl, alt and caps. You can put them together too.
            There are also functions that use many keys, like the selection of
        an instrument for example. Each group has 32 divisions, and you can
        attribute any part of these 32 divisions to a group of keys. There
        comes the setting, that gives the offset of the block's start (from 0
        to 31). These blocks are : numpad (numeric pad) and fkeys (function
        keys). For example, if you set the choice of the instruments as
        function keys + 12, when you press F1, the instrument whose name is in
        division 12 will be selected, F2 the 13th's one, etc.

            Another function takes a parameter, it's "line": go to line xx of
        the pattern.



12) Bugs: learn to know them !!!
================================

            I do think that GT doesn't have too many bugs.
        But let me warn you:
            - The memory management is not very... good (ahem...) By loading a
        mod that will fill up all the memory, there may be a crash. But if the
        mod is really too big, the error is correctly detected.
            - The sampling function in the samples editor is not very stable.
            - There may be bugs while modifying the replay frequency.
            - The black background may become white, depending on the
            resolution.
            - Depacking errors (Atomic 3.5) with very big mods
        (size > 1 Mo). It may cause a crash. The solution
        would be that someone gives me the original depack routs of Atomic 3.5
        or other routs, for I think I have the official !!!)
            - Bugs with the edition of envelopes. Well, a bit less now...
            - The SongToDisk recording is not always very stable (with a
        recording speed different from the replay frequency)
            - The tempo is not 100% exact, so the SongToDisk function
        will not create a perfectly synchronised sample, but it will if the
        recording frequency is equal to the replay frequency. If not, modify
        the frequency a few Hz.
            - Again in the SongToDisk, if your Harddisk is not fast enough, a
        a few parts willnot be recorded, and this is NOT detected by the soft.
            - Crash (rare) detected while modifying the tempo in 'Control'
        menu while the processor is very busy.
            - It may crash when you change the size of a pattern while notes
        are transfered from the MIDI port.


            I am trying to correct all the bugs I find, and all those I've
        been told about, so have no hesitation to contact me if you find
        something strange.
            Otherwise, I don't give any guarantee about the support of tuning
        cards that accelerate the 030 (040, 060, who knows ?) than the DSP. If
        I get a reasonnable demand for a special version for owners of these
        cards, I will try to release one, that shouldn't give me any problems.






IV) THE SAMPLES EDITOR
======================

            This editor is in progress, every functions are not active yet.
        The inactive functions are followed by a "(***)*.
            The use of this tool is quite easy, and users of ST-REPLAY Pro
        shouldn't be too disappointed for this sample editor uses the same
        system.

            The samples editor uses a buffer, that takes the maximum of free
        memory. Every manipulations are made on the block, defined by two
        marks.
            The screen is divided into three parts. The top window shows the
        curve of the sample. The central part contains the main icons, and the
        names of the sub-menus, that are in the third part. A fourth part may
        also appear, showing a few graphics.



1) The main commands
====================

            At the beginning, your buffer is empty. To work on a sample, you
        first have to load it into the buffer. When the work is done, you just
        have to save the block in the selected instrument. Be careful, the
        buffer uses the same memory space as the samples, so the end of the
        buffer me be sorrupted after loading a new mod or sample. You can move
        the marks (the two red bars) by clicking on their destination with the
        correct mouse button (right or left). Ther's also a third mark
        "phantom", that shows the last position of the end of block mark,
        after each manipulation.

            Let's have a look on these commands :

        ZOOM            Zooms the display window on the marks.
                        The position of the window in the buffer is displayed
                        on the right and on the left of the screen.


        ZOOM OUT        Zooms out two times the displayed buffer part.

        COPY SAMPLE     Loads a sample in the block defined by the marks.
        TO BLOCK        The number of the sample is displayed under the buffer
                        window. The sample may be converted to the buffer's
                        resolution (8 or 16 bits). If the sample is too big to
                        be loaded in the block, you can either clip it, or
                        make the block larger, so that it could contain the
                        entire sample.


        COPY BLOCK      Saves the block in the current sample.
        TO SAMPLE

        SWAP SAMPLE     Swaps between the block and the current sample. (***)
        AND BLOCK

        CLEAR           Clears the block and puts empty samples.

        CUT             Deletes the block and replaces it by the right part of
                        the buffer

        KEEP            Deletes the buffer, except the block.

        FLIP            Flips the sample in the block (reverses the sample).

        GAP (BLK)       Moves the buffer on the right, from a length equal to
                        the length of the block.


        GAP (SPL)       Idem as precedent, but from a length equal to the
                        length of the current sample.

        PLAY            Plays the block (one time). Space or right click to
                        stop it.

        FINE POS        Allows you to set very finely the block marks. Click
                        on this icon, a dialog box asks you which mark you
                        wish to modify, click at the wanted position with the
                        left button. You can scroll the window by clicking on
                        the left and right borders. When you're satisfied of
                        the position of the mark, click right to exit.




2) Numeric values on the buffer
===============================

            Under the buffer window, you find a few informations.
        You can modify these informations by clicking on them.
        Here is a small description of them:

        POS L           Shows the position of the left border of the window in
                        the buffer.

        CURS L          Position of the left mark.

        BITS            Current resolution of the work buffer.

        BLOCK           Size of the block.

        BUFFER          Size of the buffer.

        REPEAT          Repeat point (if there is one). (***)

        FREQ            Buffer frequency.

        SAMPLE          Number of the current sample. By clicking on it with
                        the right mouse button, a 'Sample' sub-menu appears.
                        To exit it, click outside of the menu, or press 'ESC'.


        CURS R          Position of the right mark.

        POS R           Position of the right border of the window.



3) Volume Menu
==============

            This part allows you to know and modify the volume of your block.


        VOLUME          This icon shows the maximum volume percentage of the
                        block. Click on itto modify it (values over 100% are
                        accepted, then the sample saturates).

        VOLUME ?        Asks the maximum volume. This volume is not computed
                        after each modification, to spare time between each
                        modification.

        ñ1, 2, 3, 6 dB  Increases or decreases the volume from n dB. +1 dB
                        increases the volume from 25%, and +3 dB increases the
                        volume two times

            There's also a menu 'Volume on effects'. You can either let the
        volume as it is after computing an effect, or force it to stay at its
        maximum, so that the quality of the sample is as good as possible,
        without any saturation (100 % volume).(***)
            You can also variate the volume in time, to create fading effects
        for example :


        FADE IN         Sets the parameters for a fade in.

        FADE OUT        Sets the parameters for a fade out.

        START           Sets the volume of fade start. Be careful, this
                        percentage corresponds to the volume of the sample,
                        100 % is the normal volume of the sample, not the
                        maximum volume.

        END             Volume of fade end.

        FADE !          Computes the fade.



4) Mix menu
===========

            You can mix samples, to create other deeper samples
        You can miw until 5 smplaes at the same time. These samples are
        specified by a few settings:

        ON              When this icon is active, the sample is taken in the
                        mix operation.

        START           Sets the start volume of the sample.

        END             End Volume.

        LOOP            The sample is looped (with its own loop setings)
                        when the icone is active.

        Num‚ro          It's the number of the sample taking all these
                        settings. 00 says that the buffer is taken as mix
                        sample. To select the current sample, click on the
                        number with the right button.


            Thanks to the MASTER icon, you can set the global volume of the
        result of the mix operation, without having to change the volume of
        every samples. Numbers 2 to 5 are presets for mixing 2 to 5 samples.
        Compute the mix operation with the MIX ! icon.




5) Record Menu
==============

    a) Warning
    ~~~~~~~~~~

            The Falcon includes a Analogic-Digital Converter (ADC),
        so it is possible to sample audio sounds. But the ones who created the
        Falcon had the strange idea to put a microphone entry (a few mV). The
        danger is that if you connect a line out to this entry, you may
        destroy the entry, for the line out is much too powerful. You can
        solve this problem by adding a serial 200 Kê resistance to each
        channel (right and left).
            There's also another problem : the entry bass-boost. This one
        increases low frequencies, that are very bad with cheap microphones.
        The bass-boost totally destroys a good quality sound... But you can
        disconnect the bass-boost with a very simple montage, that many people
        know.


    b) How to make good samples ?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            Sampling sounds is far to be an easy operation, and it asks to be
        used to it. Here are a few advices :

            - The sound mustn't saturate: before recording, set the
        monitoring on and look at the vue-meters. If these ones often
        saturate, the sound is too powerful. Decrease the volume of the audio
        source.

            - The level mustn't be to low, for you loose informations. Set the
        volume so that the sound does not saturate, and the vue-meters are at
        a maximum of 75 %. You can use the 'Auto' button the help you to set
        the volume.

            - The quality will be much better in 16 bits than in 8 bits
        but the sample will take two times more memory. 8 bits are often
        enough for sounds with constant volume; 16 bits are necessary if the
        volume variates a lot. You have then a better definition in the lowest
        volumes.

            - The sampling frequency is also very important. The higher it is,
        the better the quality of the sound will be, the the more memory it
        will take. There are sounds that support low frequencies, like the
        human voice, that keeps rather correct quality at 8 Khz. But a sound
        containing a lot of high frequencies will have to be sampled at a high
        frequency. For example a cymbal is at its full power at 32 Khz. For
        infomation, CD players are at 44.1 Khz, that is two times the maximal
        frequency a human can detect. The highest detected frequency is half
        the sampling frequency. To sample a 4 Khz sound, you must use a
        minimum of 8 Khz frequency for the sampling.

            - If you want to use low frequency samples, you'd better sample
        them at the highest frequency, to convert them later at the wanted
        frequency.


    c) The functions
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        SAMPLE          Samples a sound in the block. To stop before the end,
                        press the right mouse button or any key.

        PRESAMPLE       Samples a sound in the block, but only keeps the last
                        moments. To stop the samling, press any key or the
                        right button.

        FREQUENCY       Modifies the sampling frequency.

        TRIGGER         If this icon is active, the recording only begins when
                        the sound is at a certain level, that allows you to
                        define the position of the sound's start.

        LEVEL           It's the level of triger function. It is not necessary
                        to set lower values than 2-3%, or noise may start the
                        recording by mistake.

        L, L+R et R     The samples must be mono, so these buttons allows you
                        to choose if you want to keep the right, left voice,
                        or the two voices mixed together.

        Input Device    Selects the input device. (***) For the moment, you
                        can only use the Falcon's ADC.

        MONITOR         Listens the input. Vue-meters are activated.

        Input Level     Input level in dB for the FALCON.

        AUTO            Makes an automatic setting of the IN-level,
            depending on the source. After clicking on
            this button, play the sound you want to
            sample. The level is automatically set. Please
            note that this function gives bad results when
            the volume of a sound varies a lot and
            quickly. When you think that the volume is
            correctly set, press any key to stop.



6) Frequency Menu
=================

            This sub-menu allows you to modify your samples'
        frequency, compute FFT and tune your instruments.


    a) Resampling
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            In the middle (on the left), you find three frequencies.
        The first is the sampling frequency. The value on the left is
        the sample's current frequency, the value on the right is the
        new frequency you want to set for this sample. Below that, you
        find note names. The first note is the sample's one (you
        defined yourself, or found after computing a FFT), and the
        second is the note you want to obtain after the resampling
        operation. For example, if the start note is C 1 and you want
        to obtain C 2 (+ 1 octave), your sample's frequency will be
        multiplied by two, and its size divided by two. Note that the
        notes (!) have their frequency just below.
            On the left, you find multiply buttons (Shrink/Expand),
        that set the values to increase or decrease the sample's
        frequency with round values (changing the size AND the quality
        of the sample).
            The resampling may be computed in different ways. You can
        choose between a linear interpolation, what increases the
        quality of the result.
            Finally, the button at the top, on the left (Convert)
        computes the modifications you set. If you click with the
        right button, you don't modify the sample, but only the
        sampling frequency, depending on the note you want. So that
        you can tune your sample without modifying it, without loss of
        quality.


    b) FFT: Theory and use
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            Another aspect of this part is the FFT : this function
        analyses each frequency contained in a sound, and shows their
        power. You obtain a graph (drown at the bottom of the screen),
        with frequencies on x-axis, and powers on y-axis. In fact,
        this is a spectral analyser, which allows you to know how
        different frequencies are filled.
            You can observe, especially for instruments, some values
        that are much higher than others, and the spaces between them
        is regular:


        Power
        ^
        |
        |     |
        |     |
        |     |
        |     |     |
        |     |     |     |     ,
        |____/#\____#_____I_____I_____I_____i_____i_____;_____,_____._____.__>
                                                                         Time

            The first maximal value, usually the highest, is called
        the 'fundamental" sound. It corresponds to the basis
        frequency of the sound.
            The other maximal values are "harmonics".
        These values characterize a sound and makes it different from
        the others, for the fundamental would only produce a sinus
        wave, without specificity. Usually, even harmonics make a
        'soft' sound, and odd harmonics make a more agressive sound.
        A complex chord containing sounds with mostly odd harmonics
        will create a more 'discordant' sound than sounds containing
        mostly even harmonics.

            While searching for the fundamental with GT'S FFT tool,
        you may find an harmonic more powerful than the fundamental
        (it does exist). Don't panic, look at the fundamental
        frequency on the graph, and compute a FFT around this
        fundamental. You should find the correct value of the note.

            While searching for the frequency of a chord, be careful
        too : the FFT will only find one note of the chord, usually
        the lowest one, not necessarly the main note.
            But how to recognize a chord ? It's simple, the maximal
        values are not separed by regular spaces, for there are many
        different notes (except for octaves chords).
            Last, if your screen resolution is less than 220 lines,
        you can't see the FFT.


    c) FFT functions
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        DO              Computes the FFT. This may be long,
                        especially with big samples. Press ESC to stop
                        the computing. A click with the right button
                        will set the scanned frequencies at their
                        highest value.


        NOTE            If this button is active, after computing the
                        FFT, GT estimates the sample's note, and gives
                        its frequency in the midle, at the bottom.
                        Then you just have to click on 'Convert' to
                        tune it. Be careful, harmonics may be higher
                        than the fundamental, mistaking GT. You have
                        to verify on the graph that the found
                        frequency is really the fundamental's one.
                        You can set the display of this frequency
                        on/off (red bar on the graph), by clicking on
                        the small "Disp" next to "Sample Note".

        START           Frequency for the start of the FFT scanning.

        END             End frequency.

        # OF PTS        Number of scanned frequencies. The higher
                        this number is, the better the FFT will be,
                        but the longer the computing will be.
                        N.B.: If the "NOTE" note is active and the
                        number of points is too low, GT will take a
                        longer time to find the note.


        LINEAR/dB       Type of display. The scale of powers may be
                        linear, or logarithmic (dB).


        BLACKMAN        Blackman-type window. It increases the
                        quality of the FFT by softing the
                        interferences. But you can't use it with too
                        big samples.

        NONE            No Blackman.



7) Delay Menu
=============

            The delay, for those who are not used to sound effects,
        it's an echo...cho...o... The delay is mainly defined by two
        values : the time feed and the feedback. The first setting is
        the time between two repeats, and the second gives the volume
        of each repeat in relation to the precedent.
             The delay function in GT may be multi-tap, so instead of
         having only one impulse for each repeat, there may be many,
         displaced in comparison to the initial impulse ('Delay Time'
         parameter). If you work on stereo samples, you can create
         "ping-pong" effects, with a sound that is repeated on the
         right, then on the left, for example. Moreover, each tap has
         an independant volume ('Level') ,that increases the
         possibilities of this effect.
            You may also cut off the entry signal of the delay, while
        keeping the effect ('Mute in'), from a point you can define,
        so that you could obtain an echo only on a part of the sample.

            About the use of all this, you can set the dry and wet
        levels. If you want to obtain a regular decrease, you have to
        to set the wet level at the same percentage as the feedback.
        The feedback may be over 100%, what gives an increasing echo
        instead of decreasing ! A 0% feedback only gives one repeat.

            The settings on the right are effective only when the
        'Multi-tap mode' icon is on. Moreover, each tap is only active
        if it's 'On'.

            The effect is computed on the block, but you can choose
        your source sample. As usually, to compute the effect, you
        have to click on 'Do'. The 6 numbers under this are example
        presets :

            1 : Fast Echo
            2 : Average Echo
            3 : Slow Echo
            4 : Effect that simulates an echo in the mountain. The
                first repeat is very late (thanx to the Time Delay of
                the tap) for the mountain is far, then the other
                repeats come after each other, simulating far walls,
                at different distances.
            5 : Use of the multi-tap to simulate an echo in complex
                environment. The feedback is high, so that you could
                better hear the different effects of the multi-tap.
            6 : Very special ! The repeat period is so quick that it
                generates a new frequency. You can modify this period
                to obtain a precise note, by modifying the sampling
                frequency : new sampling feq. = (1000 * smp.freq.) /
                (Time feed * note freq.).
                Lower then the wet and dry for the delay and source
                samples are in phase, what gives a very powerul sound.




8) Flanger Menu
===============

            The flanger produces a soft modulation on a sample. It's
        very simple : there is a delay, whose delay time oscillates
        around an average value. Generally, the delay is very quick (a
        few ms). The more the oscillations' amplitude is high, the
        more you can hear the effect. And there is a feedback, as for
        every delay. When this feedback is null, the effect sounds
        like a simple vibrato. The bigger the feddback is, the more
        you hear an oscillating wave that is added to the sound.
            I didn't want to include in this samples editor a simple
        flanger as you can find in a load of softs, but a stereo
        flanger, with a stereo source and a stereo delay. It can
        produce interessant stereo effects. Anyway, for those who
        don't see the 'why' of this, or find it too complicated, a
        'Mono' option has been included.

            The effect is divided into two menus. This is the first :

        LEFT CHN        Computes the flanger, for the left channel if
                        the effect is stereo.

        RIGHT CHN       Computes the right channel of the flanger.

        MIX CHN         Computes the right and left channels, then
                        mixes them.

        DRY LEVEL       Level of the source sound.

        FLANGE LEVEL    Level of the flanger.

        FLANGE TIME     Delay time. It's not the average time, but
                        the minimum time. The delay time oscillates
                        between Time and Time + Depth. The average
                        value is Time + Depth/2.

        FLANGE FREQ     Frequency of the oscillations, in Hz.

        FLANGE DEPTH    Amplitude of the delay time modulations.

        INIT PHASE      Phase od the oscillations at the start of the
                        flanger. During the effect, the sound follows
                        a wave like this :

                               Freq.^
                                    |  ____
                                    | /    \
                                    |/      \
                                    |        \      /
                                    |         \____/
                                    |__________________> Time
                                     0  0.5  1  1.5  2
                        With this seting, you can choose where the
                        start of the oscillations is.


        PRESETS         A few presets.
                        (***)

        2nd PAGE        Access to the second menu...

            Here it is :

        LEFT SOURCE/    These are left and right source samples. In
        RIGHT SOURCE    mono mode, only the left sample is taken. By
                        clicking with the right button on the number,
                        the current sample is selected.


        FEEDBACK L -> L Gives the feedback for each delay in itself,
                 L -> R in the other. In mono mode, only L -> L is
                 R -> R active.
                 R -> L

        STEREO          Sets the stereo flanger mode on.

        MONO            Sets the mono flanger mode on; only the left
                        channel is active.

        SIN/SQUARE/...  Wave forms of the oscillations.

9) Reverb menu
==============

            The reverb simulates a room with complex reflecting walls,
        like a cathedral, a hall or a cave. It's a like a sort of echo
        (the sound is reflected by the walls), but instead of
        repeating directly in the ears of the listener, it will bounce
        on the other walls, with frequency modifications. The sound
        doesn't stop suddenly, but it fades out softly in a sort of
        whisper.
            The used algorithm is a variatio of those described by Jam
        Moorer in an article called "About this Reverberation
        Business", published in the Computer Music Journal, 1979. The
        sound is first sent in a multi-tap delay (no feedback) for
        primary reflections. Then these primary reflections are sent
        into comb-filters, that are very wuick delays with a low-pass
        filter with infinite 1st order response in their feedback
        loop. (Note from The translator : ????$^$=—N?N?$E^RP?!) What
        the comb-filters produce is then mixed and sent into a
        feedback delay, and then it is simply delayed. This last
        signal, the primary reflections and the dry sound are mixed to
        produce the final sound. That's all. (Note from the translator
        : but that's enough...)

            This reverb is complex, but it is far from beeing perfect.
        There are many reverb algorithms, each one having its own
        specificities. But by setting the parameters correctly, you can
        simulate the acoustics of many places.


    a) The main parameters
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            Many parameters are taken for the reverb, the main are
        set in the first menu. The 'advanced' parameters are in the
        second page, and will be described further.


        DRY LEVEL       It's the level of the pure sound.

        EARLY REF. LEV. It's the level of the primary reflections
                        directly mixed with the final signal. This
                        parameter increases the volume of the sound to
                        obtain a better quality.

        REVERB LEVEL    Level of the final reverb.

        SOURCE          Indicates if the source sample is the buffer
                        or the sample number xx.


            In the Early Reflection section :

        NUNBER OF TAPS  Sets the number of times you want to repeat
                        the pure sound. The higher this value is, the
                        higher the volume of the sound will be. Each
                        tap has its own time and level, you can set
                        them in the second page.


            In the Comb Filters section :

        NUMBER OF COMBS It's the number of comb filters. The higher
                        this value is, the more complex the reverb is.

        OVERALL GAIN    It's the general feedback for every combs. The
                        higher it is, the longer the reverb longs.


    b) Extended parameters
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            This is the second page. You find two panels on the left :
        the first is to modify the time and level for each tap of the
        primary reflections; the second is to modify the time and the
        gain for the comb filters' low-pass. The higher the low-pass
        gain is, the more softed the sound will be. It simulates then
        absorbing walls, like tapestries. The lower it is, the more
        'bright' the sound will be, containing more high frequencies.
        It simulates then rock or metallic walls.


            In the All Pass Reverberation section :

        DELAY           Sets the repeat time for mixing the comb
                        filters

        GAIN            It's the All Pass Reverb feedback. It
                        increases the total time of reverb without
                        having to increase the com filters' gain too
                        much.


            In the Alignement Delay section :

        DELAY           The delay of the reverb on the whole sound.
                        This parameter may correspond to the depth of
                        the room where the sound travels.




10) Song-To-Disk menu
=====================

            This part allows you to record a mod, or a part of a mod,
        as a sample, so that you could play it with a Direct-To-Disk
        soft, or use it as a sample in another mod.
            The size of these samples is rather big, so it is possible
        to record them directly on the harddisk. Be careful, the block
        will be used as a buffer, so it will be destroyed. It must be
        greater than 64 Ko, knowing that the bigger the size is, the
        less problems you will have with slow harddisks. Be careful
        when you activate the 'Monitor' function, if the disk is too
        slow, a few parts of the mod may not be recorded.
            This error is not detected. To avoid this problem, the
        disk accesses mustn't occupy more than 2/3 of the processor
        time. If it does, lower the recording speed.
             The frequency of the recorded sample is the block's one.
         This frequency must be set at a higher frequency than 12 Khz.


        RECORD          Stars recording. If Disk is selected, a file
                        selector appears. Give him the name of the
                        sample you want to create. The recording is
                        done in *.AVR or RAW.

        MONITOR         When activate, you can hear what the computer
                        records. In this case, be careful with
                        recording speeds when recording on harddisks.

        START/END       Alows you to choose the start and end
                        positions and lines. If the start line is not
                        0, the mod is played from line 0, for not to
                        destroy the notes that are played before this
                        line.

        MONO/STEREO     Sets the number of record tracks. If the
                        sample is created on the block, you can't
                        record in stereo mode.


        8 BITS/16 BITS  Sets the resolution of the sample.

        MAX DURATION    Sets the limit for the disk recording (in
            seconds)

        MAX LENGTH      Sets the limit for the disk recording (in Ko)

        RECORDING SPEED Useful in 'Monitor' mode. Sets the recording
                        speed. The lower it is, the longer it will
                        take. Be careful, if the frequency of the saved
                        sample is low, you have to use a low speed, because of possible
                        bugs.




11) Compression Menu
====================

            With the compression, you can set the lowest and highest parts of
        a sample to the same level. When the volume is too low, the volume is
        lowered. In fact this effect is similar to the 'Auto' function in the
        'Record' part. You may then get a nearly infinite sustain on an
        instrument : when the volume decreases, it is automatically increased
        by the compresser. (you should then use 16 bits high quality samples,
        for bugs are also amplified).


        DO              applies the compression on the sample.

        LEVEL           It's the volume each sample should be set at.
                        For high dynamic samples, you should set it low.

        SPEED           The speed of the adaptation of the compression to the
                        sample's volume. The smaller 'Speed' is, the
                        faster it is.

        SOURCE          Number of the sample you want to compress.





V) SHAREWARE !!!
================

1) Diffusion
============

            GT is shareware, it is free for try and it is absolutely FORBIDDEN
        to sell it (excepted by Laurent De Soras or the French Falcon Club).
        You can freely copy it, but its diffusion must respect the following
        points :
                - EVERY (compressed or not) files must be present
                - For comercial distribution and DP distributors, the disk
                mustn't cost more than 50 FF ($10 - œ7 - DM15). Moreover, the
                Graoumf Tracker mustn't lead to any gain from the distributor.
                - BBS or others: You SHOULD spread it !
                - Magazines: Ok, you can include it.




            If you ever had any problem, or if you find a bug (there might be
        some left !...), you can, er...you MUST contact me at the following
        address :    Laurent de SORAS
                     92 avenue Albert 1er
                     92500 RUEIL-MALMAISON
                     FRANCE

        or : dumbo@stmag.pressimage.fr

            If you find modules that doesn't fit Graoumf's loader, U'd be
        kind to send them to me, telling me what's wrong and where it's wrong
        in the pattern. And if you have any doc about mods or samples formats,
        please send them to me, if you want Graoumf to load these formats.

            Please write me any suggestions, any critics, what you like, it
            will show me the way I must follow to please you !






VI) COMING NEXT...
==================

            This is what I plan to do for future versions :

              * Undo/Redo
              * Capture of blocks with mouse
              * Buffer for blocks
              * Load/Save song
              * Harmonical transposition (to follow a scale)
              * Load other mod (FAR, STM, PS16, OKT, MGT...) and samples
                (SOD, DVSM, IFF...) formats
              * A tiny mix table with volumes for each track.
              * More effects in the samples editor : Chorus, Pitch
              transposer, Time stretcher, Equaliser, Noise gate, etc.
              * Loading files in archives (ZIP, LZH, ARJ, GRP, WAD (why
                not ?)
              * Karaok‚ (!!!)
              * Optimization function for muzaks, for those who want to use
                them in their programms: automatic limitation of the size of
                samples to spare Ram, delete unuseful effects, etc...
              * A real score editor, this is something that should please
                musicians.
              * A synthe, to make your own sounds using samples and FM
                synthesis.
              * Sampling CD-ROM ???


            For version 2:

              * A PC version (but no difference between the Falcon and PC
                versions)
              * Possiblility to use more than 32 tracks (but is it really
                useful ??)
              * Better management of the multi-samples instruments:
                transitions between 2 successive samples by mixing the two
                samples depending of the note, like a real synthe.
              * Groups of tracks, for secondary tracks management. A group
                may be mono or stereo, and the mix of its tracks is made as
                usually, but apart from the others. Digital effects may then
                be applied. Everything is then mixed with volume and panning
                parameters (for right and left tracks for a stereo group).
              * Digital effects without any particular algorithms, with
                every serial/parallel combinations (depending on the free
                memory).
              * Effects presets (algos, parameters, selection of the
                parameters influenced by effect tracks)
              * Special 'automation' tracks for effects / mix (to programm
                the effects' parameters)
              * Direct-To-Disk tracks
              * MIDI tracks
              * Audio in trakcs, with the same use as normal tracks (-> groups
                and digital effects)
              * If many audio outs are plugged into your computer,
                possibility to set separate tracks.


              * And many other things...





VII) GREETINGS
==================

            As usual...

            I wish to thank every human or extra-terrestrial people who
            helped and supported me in my quest for perfection, especially :

                - Gr‚gory Makles (very good ideas) and the whole Big Noz
                team
                - Christian Lim
                - Guillaume de Chant‚rac
                - Bliss, who sent me loads of docs about mod formats
                - SGT Slayer, who let me use his Falcon; without him the MIDI
                  management
                  would not be seen as soon in the Graoumf Tracker.
                - Everyone who reported me bugs and made me suggestions (and
                  I considered them all)
                - the FAUCONtact association, they're nice-top-cool
                - Julien Boeuf/Big Noz, Fantomas and Donald for their jokes
                - Sonic Youth and Nirvana, for giving the basis for the
                  Graoumf
                - Antoine, Nicolas, Alexandre, Ben, Eric, Eric and Fran‡ois,
                  I really enjoyed destroying you all in Doom II (especially
                  Nico, with him you win 1 Frag every 10 seconds).
                - The ISEP No 41 promotion
                - Judge Dredd, who hit that fucking Santa Claus
                - les Outils Wolf, pour la capacit‚ de leurs tondeuses …
                  d‚couper la chair humaine (Noter of the translator :
                  untranslatable...)
                - David Vincent, who makes his cadavers disappear the
                  fingers in the nose.
                - Don Coscarelli, for having written and realised the awful
                  Phantasm I, II et III (awfully funny !!!)

            and errrr... many others !



            Enjoy life, and long life to the Graoumf musak !



                                                        L. de SORAS, 05/12/96
