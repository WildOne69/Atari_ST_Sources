SHAREWARE licence and distribution
==================================

            GRAOUMF TRACKER is SHAREWARE. It may be freely copied and
        distributed in its limited version (without saving options), but if
        you want to use it and to have the full package you will have to pay
        the registration fee, which is 100 FF minimum (or the equivalent in
        Pounds, Dollars or Marks) ($25, 13 Pounds or 30 DM). By paying the
        fee (and fillig the register formulary, located at the end of the
        GT_DOC.TXT file), you get the very last version of GRAOUMF TRACKER,
        and the possibility to get the newest versions later, by sending a
        blank HD disk.

            The payment must be sent to the following address for France:

            Laurent de SORAS
            92 avenue Albert 1er
            92500 Rueil-Malmaison
            FRANCE

            The payment must be sent to the following address for every other
        countries (except France):

            French Falcon Club,
            5 Rue Hochweg
            67850 OFFENDORF
            FRANCE

            The full package contains:
            - The very last G.T. demo pack,
            - The full program for Falcon, with saving options,
            - The English documentation,
            - A module converter,
            - Falcon Screen 2.85 (a resolution enhancer),
            - Assembler and GfA .GT2 replay routine sources,
            - Demo mods and high quality samples, if you send HD disks or
        EZ-135 cartridges.

            You can of course send me your productions, I'm very curious to
        ear what you compose with the Graoumf Tracker! Tell me if you want
        I distribute your modules (or I do not).



Running the program
===================

            Just 2xClick on GTRACKER.PRG. The program switch automaticaly to
        the nearest 80 columns/16 colors resolution, with overscan for RGB
        monitors. Enhanced resolutions are suported (Falcon Screen 2, Videl
        Inside, Screen Blaster, CentScreen...) I recommend you a double-line
        resolution for VGA, and no interlace for RGB, because with a 1:1 pixel
        ratio, screen looks too squashed! You can configure that by editing
        the preference ASCII file GTKPREFS.INF.
            To quit the program, click on the top-left of the screen.

            To get all the fonctions, please read entirely the documentation!
