     The  mono emulator lets you use the high resolution mode  on 
the atari ST, using a normal TV or monitor - i.e., you don't have
to fork out  œ150 on an Atari SM125 High-rez mono monitor, if you
want to run  programs such as Signum, PCB designer, various  Midi 
programs, PD utilities etc.

     This is the Third major version of the program.  The  first 
was  printed in Popular Computing Weekley in Vol 6 Nos 43  &  44. 
This version has a number of improvements:

     o It will now run on both the old and new versions of TOS
     o It can (must actually) be run from an AUTO folder
     o It works with SNAPSHOT.ACC
     o It is twice as fast as versions 1 and 2
     o It does not crash if you run it on a mono monitor
       so you can leave it in the AUTO folder

How to use it.
--------------

     Just copy it ( MONO_EMU.PRG ) into an AUTO folder. Then boot 
from  this disk.  It will load automatically and display a  short 
message.  There  will  be a prompt at the bottom  of  the  screen 
asking  you to input  a number from  10 to 80.  This controls how 
often  the  screen is updated and also, how much your program  is 
slowed down by the emulator.  An input of 10 gives a rather jerky
display, but there is no noticeable decrease in speed.  Using 80,
is very smooth  but the  ST runs at about 56% of its normal speed
If you just press " Return", you will get the default setting  of
40, the ST will run at  75% of its  normal speed and the  display
will be quite smooth enough
     After  entering  the speed,  you should  be  returned  to  a 
monochrome desktop with a grey background and little  icons.  You 
should  now  be  able to load and  run  any  monochrome  program. 
The mono emulator uses  about 34K  of memory, so if you have only 
got 512K of RAM then you may  encounter problems with some of the 
larger  programs.   This is  more likely  if you  have some  desk 
accessories loaded.

     You should use the mono emulator from an AUTO folder.  If you
simply load the program in the normal way, you will get a squashed
half-screen  version of the desktop.  If  you  now  go up  to  the
Options menu, select "Set Preferences"  and then click  "OK",  you
will get the normal mono desktop back, but the menus and the dialog
boxes will be squashed.  Most odd!


The New Roms.
-------------

     The  original mono emulator  used lots of ROM addresses  and 
only worked with the right ROM.  Version  3.00  only uses one ROM
address, used  to tell TOS to configure itself to being  in  mono 
mode.  I have not yet worked  out how to do without this  routine. 
If  anybody does find a way that will be compatible with all  the 
ROMs, then please do write and tell me.

     As  the  ROM call is different for each version of  TOS, the 
program has to detect which version of TOS is installed and  then 
alter  itself  accordingly.   To  do the detecting, it checks the
date-of-creation bytes, which are stored at address $FC0018 in the
ROM.  The program  then searches  through a table until it  finds
this date;  then takes  the address  of the ROM  routine from the
table and inserts it in the  program.  If the  date is not found,
it will print  a message saying so, and default to the V1.08  TOS
though it will then probable crash.

     At the moment (11 April 1988) the table only has entries for 
two TOS's, the old and the new British versions. These have dates 
of 20/11/85 and 22/4/87, with corresponding ROM routines at $FCA76A 
and  $FCA914.  However, if you  do not have  one of these, do not
despair; all is not yet lost.  It is not very difficult to change.
All you need to do is find the ROM creation date (which is simply
whatever  is stored  in the  long word at $FC0018) and then  find
the corresponding ROM routine.

     The ROM routine is called from the XBIOS routine "SETSCREEN" 
and the easiest way to find it is to set up a bit of code like:

          MOVE.W #1,-(SP)
          MOVE.L #-1,-(SP)
          MOVE.L #-1,-(SP)
          MOVE.W #5,-(SP)
          TRAP #14
          ADD.L #12,SP
          RTS

Then use a debugger (I used K-Seka) to single step through the ROM
call,  until you have  got past the   JMP (A0)  instruction in ROM.
Then you should come across a bit of code like:

     FC0982 TST.L   $0004(A7)
     FC0986 BMI     $FC098E
     FC0988 MOVE.L  $0004(A7),$044E(A5)
     FC098E TST.L   $0008(A7)
     FC0992 BMI     $FC09A4
     FC0994 MOVE.B  $0009(A7),$FF8201.L
     FC099C MOVE.B  $000A(A7),$FF8203.L
     FC09A4 TST.W   $000C(A7)
     FC09A8 BMI     $FC09CE
     FC09AA MOVE.B  $000D(A7),$044C(A5)
     FC09B0 BSR     $FC0726
     FC09B4 MOVE.B  $044C(A5),$FF8260.L
     FC09BC CLR.W   $0452(A5)
     FC09C0 JSR     $FCA76A.L            <--- this is it
     FC09C6 MOVE.W  #$0001,$000452.L
     FC09CC RTS

     This is  from the  old British ROM, in which the  number  is 
$FCA76A.  The routine should  be the same in other TOS's,  so you
should be able to find it quite easily. If you  do have problems,
get in touch with me.

     When you  have got the two numbers, you need to add  them to
the source code.  The table  is right at the end.  Insert them in 
the place indicated by the comment,  but be sure they are  before 
the line 'DC.L $0,$0'.  For example suppose the numbers you  find 
are $02061986 and $FCA822 then you should add the line :

          DC.L $02061986,$00FCA822  ; German (or wherever)

     If you do find  any new ROMs, please sent the numbers  to me,
so that I can keep up to date.

     This  really is a tedious way of doing things  so  if  anyone 
does come up  with a way of doing  without the ROM call, which  is 
compatible with all ROMs then PLEASE let me know.  In the meantime
this will have to suffice.

     If  you  want to  write to me  with  any  numbers,  problems, 
comments, money (it is shareware you know, and it saved you œ150), 
or anything else then write to:
