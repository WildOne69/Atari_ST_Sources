* What's Ametyste ?                                         *
*                                                           *
*                                                           *
* Asm coders, knows that it can be dangerous to code demos  *
* or games, coz you need speed and to do that, only one     *
* thing : killing all systems functions or calls ! But the  *
* little problem is when you have an error, the PRG doesn't *
* come back to Devpac (Turbo-asm, etc....) coz no           *
* interrupt, screen not at good address, etc....            *
*                                                           *
* So here come a little solution : Ametyste                 *
*                                                           *
* Ametyste will modify the bus, adress, illegal, div by     *
* zero, CHK vector to avoiding the non come back.           *
*                                                           *
* When you have an error, Ametyste will restore some        *
* registers (MFP, video, Yamaha, etc...), display some      *
* infos (Error number, 68000 registers), wait some time     *
* and come back to your editor.                             *
* The reset vector is modified too, for neverending loop !  *
*                                                           *
* The only thing to do is to put Ametyste on the root       *
* of the boot disk (A: for drive disk, C: for hard drive)   *
*                                                           *
* When you open the .ACC, you have some choices :           *
*                                                           *
* - State : Installed means the vectors errors are the      *
*           Ametyste one.                                   *
*           Removed means the vectors errors are the        *
*           original one (Same at the boot)                 *
*                                                           *
* - Reset : same thing as State                             *
*                                                           *
* - Resave state : If you have modified some registers      *
*                  and you want Ametyste to resave it       *
*                                                           *
* Shortcut keys are between brackets (S) means Ctrl+S       *
* you can close Ametyste with (C) (Ctrl+c)                  *
*                                                           *
* The last thing, you can send an adress rout to Ametyste.  *
* After an error, Ametyste will display infos, wait a key   *
* and after jump to your rout.                              *
*                                                           *
* To do that : just put our adress rout in a0.l             *
*              and calling trap #4                          *
*              But don't forget to quit in your rout !      *
*                                                           *
* Display infos : when you do an error, on the screen are   *
*                 displayed the 68000 registers (Dx, Ax)    *
*                 and the error number by some little cars  *
*                 in the end of display.                    *
*                 2 Cars means Bus error                    *
*                 3 Cars means Adress error                 *
*                 ..........................                *
*                                                           *
* The display rout is only med rez, sorry for low res       *
* coders, display will be a little bit hot !!               *
*                                                           *
* This version run only on STF/STE, i've got a falcon one   *
* but this doesn't run 100% correctly. When i got a little  *
* bit of time, i will do it better. Or you can do one with  *
* this, coz the source are given. If you do a Falcon one    *
* contact me (GT Turbo).                                    *

*                                                           *
