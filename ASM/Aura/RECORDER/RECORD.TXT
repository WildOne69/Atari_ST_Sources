This little proggy converts tunes which dont use IRQs (digidrums or
SID voice). The tunes have to be in standart MadMax format (3 branches).

The proggy is very little and coded very fast, so the commandline
reading is VERY sensible. Probably I will improve the frontend script
to reduce the problems.

Call it:   record.ttp [-txxyy] [-nzz] snd_file ym_file

where -t is recordingtime, xx are minutes, yy seconds.
      -n is tunenumber (in d0 at soundinit)
      snd_file is the file to record
      ym_file is the file you want to write (not compressed!)

e.g.:  record -t0412 cuddly1.snd cuddly1.bin
       records tune 1 of cuddly1.snd for 4 minutes 11 seconds
       and write result to cuddly1.bin

e.g.:  record -t0914 -n04 xy.snd xy.bin
       records tune 4 of xy with 9:14 length

Always use two digits for the numbers !!!

To get a "real" YM file you have to compress the output files.

Problems: The proggy isnt very stable, but can handle register 13 in
most files automatically.
Probably there will be sometimes more features, who knows.

To get complete YM files in one pass, use the Shellskript (for the
Mupfel-Shell (Gemini)) REC.MUP. For doks see there (it directly calls
the packer).
