This is a very little player for MadMax synth tunes (no digis), all
the files in .SND format on the ST Sound page.

Runs with Timer-A, so it can be used with 60Hz or on Falcon-VGA.

The only "good" thing is it can handle the SNDH-Fileheader: Name of
the tune and composer and tune information included in the files.
If a tune have this header (mostly all tunes on the ST Sound page
(it was sucking work to include the headers...)), the informations
will be displayed.

Press "r" if you want to have the sound resistant.
